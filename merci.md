_No Photo Merci_ collects photography from a one-month photographic excursion across France during the days just prior to the global pandemic. By using a very constrained set of compositional rules, it celbrates essentially French visual culture in the early 21st century.

_No Photo Merci_ is available as an individual book or packaged with an editioned print from the project.
