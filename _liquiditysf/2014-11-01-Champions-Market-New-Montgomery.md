While I've occasionally carried both Fuji cameras, I have't really used them as a pair, both 'round my neck, until yesterday's rainy fiesta. Given the weather I used only the standard zoom on the XT-1 and set the two cameras at widely varying ISOs -- after the setup I never touched any settings that weren't on the top-deck dials or the lens rings, so the transitions back and forth between them were almost invisible. A great team.
