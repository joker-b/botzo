<p><i>" I mean, photography is all right if you don't mind looking at the world from the point of view of a paralyzed cyclops for a split second. But that's not what it's like to live in the world, or to convey the experience of living in the world."</i> - David Hockney</p>

<p>Many years ago <a href="http://www.hockneypictures.com/" target="_blank">David Hockney</a> came to look at working with us at Digital Productions, to satisfy a curiosity of his about perspective. It seemed to me that he was after the notion that every object -- perhaps even every varying surface of an object -- might have its own frame of perspective, it's own lens and vanishing point.</p>

<p>At the time the whole idea of applying computer graphics to explore this idea was prohibitively expensive and now, when it's easier, he's moved on in different ways (his <a href="http://www.artbaselmiamibeach-online.com/en/Annely-Juda-Fine-Art,c174134" target="_blank">large prints from iPad paintings</a> were going for ~$98K a pop at Art Basel last week). But that idea has always stuck with me because I could see a truth in it: that "realism" was an "ism" and that there may be others -- even using tools designed to make realism automatic -- that are just as true.</p>
