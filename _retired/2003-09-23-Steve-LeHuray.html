<p><a href="http://www.streetphoto.net/" target="slframe">Steve LeHuray</a> passed away suddenly last week, <a href="http://www.topica.com/lists/streetphoto/read/message.html?mid=908671292&sort=d&start=39587" target="slframe">apparently</a> from a heart attack. In addition to his love of a very 1950's-traditional style of street photography, Steve was also a media entrepreneur and founder of the magazine <a href="http://www.icommag.com/" target="slframe">ICOM.</a></p>

<p>Steve was very much an old-school style of <i>flaneur</i> photographer, one who saw his shooting as a means to approach <a href="http://www.streetphoto.net/pawimages2002/wk26.jpg" target="slframe">everyday theatre</a> and through it try to glimpse something of the essence of humanity. It's no surprise he was very involved in the Leicaphile collective "Family of Man 2" project of a couple of years ago. I didn't always buy his theories or his photos, but he certainly did, they meant a lot to him and gave his effort a sense of personal meaning. Sometimes I think that might be the best one can hope for.</p>

<p>Let me rip him off here, from <a href="http://www.topica.com/lists/streetphoto/read/message.html?mid=901481958" target="slframe">this posting,</a> date 19 Sept 2001:</p>

<blockquote><i><p>...with the upcoming WTO/IMF protests a couple weeks away in Washington I
posted for my wk36 PAW this protest picture, "Convert the War Machine":</p>

<p>Then four days later came the World Trade Center/Pentagon attack. I felt
devastated and helpless. So I needed some time to think.</p>

<p>I spent time thinking (maybe I do that to much) and in particular about my
photography, my kind of photography which by now most people who have been
following my PAW realize that what I mostly do is Street Photography. And I
asked myself, why do I do Street Photography for many years now? I knew what
the answer would be. Because of the confusing state, to me, of world
affairs, I know that I take pictures of complete strangers because somewhere
in those pictures there is an answer, if only for me, as to why we all are
what we are.</p></i></blockquote>

<p>Working through those particualr mysteries engaged him to the end &#151; as witnessed by <a href="http://www.streetphoto.net/paw2003/wk37.html" target="slframe">Steve's final PAW Photo.</a></p>

<p>So long, sl.</p>
