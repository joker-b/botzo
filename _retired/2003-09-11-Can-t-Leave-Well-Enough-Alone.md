A few site changes, mostly cosmetic &#151; the biggest a switch from dynamically-sized layouts to a stodgy old fixed-width format for this journal. <a href="http://www.geekychick.net">Someone</a> reminded me that not everyone has laptops that can display a 1920x1200 IE window :)

I also got comfortable with the new <a href="/photo/salon/gindex.html">street photography randomizer,</a> so rebuilt the associated pages.... and in the course of <i>that,</i> found lots of little missing meta tags, broken links, URLs to nowhere, etc. Fixed, fixed, fixed, and fixed.

Hey, anything to avoid vacuuming and cleaning-out the stacks of old magazines from under my bed.
