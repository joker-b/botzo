![Acros, 1951 vintage Serenar 50mm f/1.8, Canon IIIa (C) 2002 Kevin Bjorke]({{ 'http://www.botzilla.com/bpix/sep02l-04.jpg' | absolute_url }}){: .align-right}
<a href="http://www.jobo-usa.com/faq/durst_variable_contrast_printing.htm" target=linkframe">The enlarger</a> is working again. Five years in storage had let a tiny bit of corrosion get on the lamp pins. A wiggle or two on the contacts and <i>voila.</i>

Went around with a meter and the <a href="http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/iannorris/leica_copies/leica_copies_c/canonIIIa.htm">IIIa</a> today. No photos after 8AM, but the meter got used anyway, taking notes.

NVIDIA interiors are EV 7 day and night. My dining room is EV 5, kitchen EV 6. Bedroom around EV3, depending on distance from the big paper lantern. So now I don't need a meter.... NVIDIA is three stops down from open shade which is four stops down from sunny-16. The dining room is two stops down from NVIDIA. What more could I need?
