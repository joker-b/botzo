<p>The <a href="http://www.topendsports.com/weight-loss/diet-flash.htm">flash diet</a> doesn't require using flash, and it isn't really a diet <i>per se,</i> but an alternative to keeping a food diary -- photograph <a href="/blog/archives/000464.html">everything you eat.</a> A side benefit is that it gives you an excuse to make at least a few photographs every day.</p>

<p>For entertainment value I've given myself a little rubric:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; Celphone only: twee "FX" apps okay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; "One bullet": c'mon, it's time to eat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; Context: ingredients, locations, companions</p>

<p>Here is a great thing about celphone cameras: they're not Hasselblads. They're more like a real <a href="http://www.thepencilofnature.com/">"pencil of nature,"</a> in that a pencil has incredible range -- you can use the same pencil to jot down the grocery list or to draw a <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/europe/michelangelos_drawings/michelangelos_drawings.aspx">masterwork.</a> The Hasselblad is more like oil paints -- wonderful for what it does, but too grand and technically involved for casual muddling.</p>
