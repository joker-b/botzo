I'm not a real doctor, but I am really me. I got a <a href="http://www.electronicimaging.org/program/06/conferences/index.cfm?fuseaction=6065">session </a> accepted for the  <a href="http://www.electronicimaging.org/program/06/">IS&T/SPIE Electronic Imaging 2006</a> conference, coming up in January. In an unusual move for me, this will be a purely-tech talk &#151; I might try blowing a <i>little</i> art smack, but it is what it says: "Image Processing on Parallel GPU Units."

Oddly, my acceptance letter came addressed to "Dr. Kevin Bjorke." Never knew it was that easy.

I'll also be a speaker at <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/homepage.htm">GDC</a> in March &#151; giving a production-centered presentation titled "When Shaders and Textures Collide."
