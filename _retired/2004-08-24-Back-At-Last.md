![Back At Last]({{ 'http://www.botzilla.com/bpix/backAtLast.jpg' | absolute_url }})


Back from a long delay &#151; though not for lack of trying! Botzilla's server was swapped on the very night of the previous post (just before being out of town for a week), and the new host configuration was full of undocumented differences. All should be functional once more, though a few lingering cgi permissions problems remain (pretty much every cgi script has required some sort of tweak or rewrite).
