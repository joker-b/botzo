The lurch in journal entries of late has been almost entirely due to <a href="http://www.siggraph.org/s2003/">Siggraph 2003,</a> jusy finished in San Diego. I spent the week there, giving about eight classes in <a href="http://www.cgshaders.org">Cg</a> all week and helping <a href="http://www.siggraph.org/awards/1995/AchievementAward.html">Kurt Akeley</a> with demos for his <a href="http://www.siggraph.org/s2003/conference/courses/olano.html">real-time shading course.</a> I put in a little <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/IO_7997.html">booth duty for NVIDIA</a> and some demo time for <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/studio">Studio Relations</a> while I was there, too &#151; so a ver busy week.

Perhaps my perspective is warped but this really seemed to be the year that real-time shading was everywhere. Every major design application either has realtime shading (usually via Cg) or is scrambling to add realtime shading. Last year I thought that the new, meaty edition of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1568811829/qid=1060230108/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/103-8431387-7825406?v=glance&s=books&n=507846"><cite>Real Time Rendering</cite></a> was poised to be the new industry bible, as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201848406/qid=1060230150/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-8431387-7825406?v=glance&s=books"><cite>Foley &ampl; van Dam</cite></a> had been in the previous decade (or two). This year that notion felt vindicated.

The hardware scene was otherwise sparse &#151; the show is definitely smaller than in years past, and this year &#151; no SGI on the show floor! No IBM either, as far as I could tell. Sunrise, sunset.

And speaking of sunsets, the coolest new piece of kit has to be <a href="http://www.sunnybrooktech.com/">Sunnybrook Technologies's</a> new high-dynamic range <i>display.</i> With a range of around 70,000 to 1, the display can show almost as wide a range of luminanaces as your eye can see. In HDR photos of a sunset, I could see detail in the dark landscape, or in the sky &#151; but not both at the same time. As one of my colleagues opined: "it's almost like looking out a window."

The <i>other</i> cool hardware device was my new (temporary? hmmm) laptop, a <a href="http://www.dell.com/us/en/bsd/products/model_precn_precn_m60.htm">Dell Precision M60 Mobile Workstation.</a>

I know Courtney likes <a href="http://www.geekychick.net/blog/archives/000510.php#000510">her new toy</a> but the M60 is pretty darned sweet (and big) &#151; not only a 1920x1200 display, but an integrated NVIDIA Quadro FXGo 700 GPU &#151; not just a GeForce FX, but a Quadro FX &#151; which provides hardware pixel shaders, vertex shaders, and the full-powered oomph to run (as I do) <a href="http://www.alias.com/">Maya,</a> <a href="http://www.softimage.com/">SoftImage XSI,</a> and <a href="http://www.discreet.com/">3ds Max</a> on the laptop. In fact, as a lark I ran them all at the same time :) Sorry <a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/">Chris,</a> and sorry for having to miss <a href="http://www.gnomedex.com/">Gnomedex,</a> but Dell really <i>does</i> rule.
