On the other end of the world, a series of photos that tell another Truth, much different from <a href="/blog/archives/000293.html">this one.</a>

In a compelling and grim way, without a trace of Barthes-like deconstruction or pretense to art. We're left without any possible recourse but to take these photos at their horrible face value. Direct from the former USSR &#151; <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/extreme4/kiddofspeed/page2.html">The Dead Zone.</a>
