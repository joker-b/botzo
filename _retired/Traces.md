Hmm, got a message from <a href="http://www.proofsheet.com/">Michal Daniel</a> that it's already time for another <a href="../photo/salon/">street photography salon</a> &#151; photo web submissions are due tomorrow by midnight. This time the theme is "trace" and once again I haven't gone and made a doggoned thing for it. Will have to dig through the archives, though I'd prefer to shoot something new.

Haven't really had time for it this weekend, been struggling with last-minute tweaks to my taxes &#151; might have to file an extension if I can't find all of the receipts right away, though I'm happy to report that for Hawaii, California, and the IRS, I get refunds all around even without them. I just want to find the right receipts (mostly moving-related) so I can crank those refunds up just a tad more.
