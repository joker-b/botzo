I started using a <a href="http://del.icio.us/nvidia/">new del.icio.us account</a> recently, specifically to share GPU-related research and resources with developers and co-workers.

Why a new account, rather than some handily-unique tag? Mostly so that the account could be shared by my colleagues, separately from their or <a href="http://del.icio.us/nvidia/">my</a> personal accounts.

If you're interested in these sorts of resources, compiled by a group who really are the best in the world at these things, <a href="http://del.icio.us/rss/nvidia/">subscribe</a>...
