Quite the sad eruption of pronouncements in <a href="http://www.apug.org/site/main/viewtopic.php?t=3270&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0">this thread</a> over at <a href="http://www.apug.org/">APUG.</a>

Seems that <a href="http://www.duckspool.com/tutors/Les%20McLean/les_mclean.htm" rel="colleague">Les McLean,</a> hardly a stranger to traditional processes, what with his workshops, magazine columns, and <a href="http://www.rhdesigns.co.uk/cbwp.html">books</a> on traditional B&amp;W processes, actually had the temerity to suggest that printing his negatives digitally was a good idea &#151; and that he might actually discuss it on APUG!

Amid a few voices of reason were responses like: "most people who use digital don't know an F-stop from a newton ring" &#151; "...this would cause  this site to spiral out  of control..." one would think they're discussing gay marriage and the end of English-speaking civilization. <i>Just look what happened to Sweden!</i>

Les's attitude was simple enough: "I will respond positively to any developments in image making that may help me improve how I express myself."

But the siege mentality had already set in: "...the beginning of the breach in the dike..." &#151; "digital forum....trojan horse" and accusations that these attitudes were justified by the supposed bad behavior of outsiders or apostates: "the attitude of everyone I've met "over there" is one of marked INtolerance" &#151; "I don't think that some here 'know what APUG is about'"

Gee, I thought it was about the pictures?

Given the emphasis of some on nostalgic subjects and aesthetics, it all seems close to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_art">academic painting,</a> with its emphases on historic and mythical subjects:

<i>"L'acad&eacute;misme est une attitude esth&eacute;tique qui se d&eacute;finit &agrave; divers niveaux: chez l'artiste, qui se r&eacute;signe &agrave; cultiver un art de moyens, en appliquant, sans chercher &agrave; les d&eacute;passer, des recettes d'atelier emprunt&eacute;es &agrave; autrui et se garde d'innover pour respecter soit la tradition officiellement &eacute;tablie, soit toute autre tradition artistique ayant fait ses preuves; chez l'amateur d'art, qui pr&ocirc;ne l'esth&eacute;tique de la ressemblance, adopt&eacute;e par la critique officielle, par le jury des Salons, par le public &laquo;bourgeois&raquo;."</i>

<i>"Acad&eacute;misme</i> is an aesthetic attitude defined at various levels:  in the artist, who resigns himself to cultivate an art of correctness, while applying, without seeking to exceed them, the recipes of craft borrowed from others while taking care not to innovate, to respect either the officially established tradition or any other artistic tradition having proven reliable;  in the art lover, who preaches the esthetics of the resemblance, adopted by official criticism, by the jury of the Shows, and the middle-class public."</i>

Ugh.

<i>Bon appetit,</i> y'all.
