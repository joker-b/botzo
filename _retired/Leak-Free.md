<center><i>Not a Robust Test</i></center>

Well, shucks. On the film roll loaded immediately after the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-04-29-Leak %}">Leaky One</a> -- within just five or ten minutes of that previously-shown light-stained shot -- the results now appear 100% leakless, including the snapshot above.

Mystery leaks: they happen. I've read about cameras that have been sent to one expensive technician after another, and yet the leak was never found. Or maybe it's some subtle mistake I made for that one roll. Lens change? I doubt it.

Every photo should have an element of mystery, sure. Just usually not this kind.
