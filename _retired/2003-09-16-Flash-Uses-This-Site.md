I keep trying to keep up with the many submissions for the <a href="/photo/strobeVolts.html">strobe listing page,</a> but it's not as easy as it might look &#151; they come in pretty steadily (one or two a day), and I transcribe them pretty haphazardly. Fits and starts, but I'm still about 100 listings behind. For those of you who've posted measurements since about mid-May, please be patient... I've got a lot of writing and coding to do on other work besides this website.

Let that be a lesson to me... pages like that one, or the <a href="/searches.html">search dada page,</a> that need regular labor-intensive management, can be a pain. I'm thankful for the help, and glad to put up public service sites like the strobe listing... but it's still a pain.

I've thought about further-automating the input process, but fear that it would get filled with vandalism and spam, as have the various <a href="/photo/photoBook/pbook.html">guestbooks</a> on other parts of Botzilla. Annoyingly, some "clever fella," apparently in Germany, has written a robot that goes around to website guestlogs and writes little compliments in them, like "love your site!"

What's wrong with this, you might ask? Well, for one, it's dishonest &#151; the robot never really looks at the site, it's just prowling for web forms that follow a known pattern of controls. Second, and more importantly, those little compliments are loaded-up with advertising URLs for German car-financing companies. <i>Feh.</i> So I've had to run around cleaning up those cheery little turds, too &#151; and re-writing my guestbook scripts to deter the robots.
