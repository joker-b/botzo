...as if <a href="http://www.botzilla.com/blog/archives/000603.html">on cue,</a> I received a letter from Schmap saying that they are planning to use one of my photographs in their (allegedly non-commercial but obviously ad-revenue-driven) travel guides.

Not particularly surprising to me, the photo was <i>not</i> marked with a Creative Commons tag, but rather as "&copy; All Rights Reserved."  Maybe they don't realize that I habitually send CDs of thumbnails to the Copyright Office to actually register my pix?

Ooops.
