<p>I can't give you everything, but I can give you this. I know, it's not your birthday yet &#151; but let's take the moment to celebrate. Let's fill that blank card  like so:</p>

<!--more-->
<p>Courtney, Happy Birthday with love. May your entire day be filled with friends and friendship, to celebrate how wonderful it is that you Are, so exactly, You &#151; and that the world exists as a better place with you in it.</p>

<p>I hope &#151; I know &#151; that you are enjoying your new life, this first birthday apart &#151; close to friends and the City you love, and filled with opportunities for you to be <i>you,</i> in ways that seemed so  impossibly difficult here. It's love for you that is glad to help and to see you grow, to see you live free and beyond possessiveness and expectations.</p>

<p>Sorry for how I have been &#151; childish things I have done in adjusting to our new lives. We deserve better than that &#151; there have already been plenty of tears for us. They come to me now, smearing my notepad and wiped off the keys as I type.</p>

<p>It's love, that in letting you go, accepts these tears &#151; tears of happiness and hope for You, and yes tears for The Sorrow of Us. These tears are not optional. Letting you go as an act of love includes accepting more than just losing your constant company and touch, it means accepting these tears too. For us. Does it mean accepting all of your changes? Yes. Even to the thought that you might one day find new joy in the company and embrace of another? Yes. For both of you? Even that. So lucky for them. For you both.</p>

<p>My birthday wish: to say Thank You, Courtney. Thank you for eight years of True Love like nothing else in my life. And thank you for a future as True Friends. Maybe your birthday gift is really to me.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that doesn't get me through a sea of tears<br \>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over life's biggest tragedy</i><p>

<p><i>So long ago, you're so far away<br \>
but my dream lives on forever<br \>
I guess I believe that I'll see you one day<br \>
For without it, there is no dream</i></p>

<p><i>So far away, so long ago<br \>
but my dream lives on forever<br \>
and how much I loved you<br \>
you'll never know<br \>
till you join me within my dream</i></p>

<p><i>And how much I loved you<br \>
You'll never, never know<br \>
Till you join me within my dream</i></p></blockquote></blockquote>
