I spent a good chunk of today letting search engines search. I was looking for blog sites that seemed interesting to me, and sad to say there was a lot more searching than finding.

Lots of typical sites &#151; meg upon meg of toycam and pencam and pincam photos, lots of grinning heads, brightly-colored market stalls, pigeons and rainy windowsills. But little &#151; very little &#151; of work and thought that seemed as if someone had worked or thought very hard.

Nature of the beast, I guess. When everyone got desktop publishing, we were buried in paper. Video cameras, buried in home movies. And there are some regions of light in the swampy fog. But also a lot of swamp.

One problem seems to be the technology &#151; people are so caught-up in the latest tool, and their blogs are largely expressions of fashionability (which thrives on conformity). There is a broad, deep culture of "me too!" that is at once central to the nature of blogging and at the same time inhospitable to independant, demanding, work. The blogiverse seems to be more about quantity that quality. Why have three amazing photos when we can have 780 mediocre variations on the same obvious idea by 600 people?

If it floats your boat, great. But among those 780 photos are the three amazing ones. I, for one, will tire after the first dozen, which puts my chances of seeing even <i>one</i> of the amazing shots at something like ((777!*772!)/(780!*769!)) which is only about 4%

That's a lot of googling.

Remember <i>The Treasure of Sierra Madre,</i> the explanation that gold's value lies not in its inherent qualities but in the <a href="http://www.whysanity.net/monos/treasure.html">thousands of wasted hours</a> spent looking for each tiny nugget?

There are some glimmers of hope &#151; I found a few sites worth blogrolling, a few veins that might be worth tapping. I'm not entirely discouraged yet.

If anyone knows of <i>any</i> 3D computer animation sites, let me know.
