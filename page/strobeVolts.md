This list was originally compiled around 2001 to 2005, using generously crowd-sourced measurements. Many of the companies listed (and the links to the contributors) have been gone for years (Hi Monolta!). The list is still hosted here but rarely expanded. If you're really in doubt, just get yourself a new Godox and be very happy.

<h2>Is your old strobe safe to use on your new electronic camera?</h2>

Some older strobes (and infrared strobe triggers) use high voltages in the trigger circuit.  For mechanical cameras, this is fine &#151; but many newer, electronically-driven or digital cameras can be damaged by excessive strobe voltages.

<i>How much is too much? What voltage might my own strobe generate?</i> This page tries to help answer those questions.  It contains a table of strobe trigger voltages, a few measured by myself but most contributed by readers of this site, along with some information about specific camera makes and the strobes that light them:

<h2>Camera Info (as of around 2005)</h2>

*Canon* US has verified (to me, and <a href="https://www.botzilla.com/photo/photoBook/pbook.html#msg226">here</a>) that the Powershot G doesn't like voltages over 6V.

Similarly, *Nikon* has specified 12V for their speedlight circuits... (though reader Steve Francesoni called Nikon.uk to check, and their tech rep said that his N80 was good to 250V &#151; so there may be more complexity to this story). I've heard some <i>rumours</i> that some Coolpix models have been restricted to 5V! (see <a href="#nikon250">below</a> for more details)

Marco Fortin-Metzgen checked with *Olympus* Europe on his C4040 &#151; that digicam has a trigger voltage of 10V, so Olympus too recommends strobe triggering in the 3V to 6V range.

*Pentax* users may want to read <a href="https://www.botzilla.com/photo/photoBook/pbook.html#msg200">this related story</a> from Gene Poon.

Ron Alexander claims his *Fuji* is astonishingly tolerant of high voltages... interesting (This has since been verified by Rob Scrimgeour of the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/fujigroup/">FujiGroup.net forum</a> &#151; their members got a message from Fuji also stating the 400V center pin limit).

(According to <a href="http://www.photo.net/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=000Dwt">some opinions,</a> high voltages can even endanger mechanical cameras, albeit after years of use)

The <a href="http://webstore.ansi.org/ansidocstore/product.asp?sku=ISO+10330%3A1992">ISO 10330 specification</a> ("Photography -- Synchronizers, ignition circuits and connectors for cameras and photoflash units -- Electrical characteristics and test methods," 1992) says that all ISO-compliant cameras should be able to accept trigger voltages up to 24V. Though a Canon engineer is the nominal head of the ISO workgroup, for some reason Canon continues to insist that their cameras tolerate no more than 6V (make that Canon <i>USA</i> &#151; an email from Canon <i>Canada</i> says: _"There is not a maximum voltage requirement for the hot shoe terminal on the PowerShot G1."_ Go fig!). For that reason I've tagged strobes that trigger at voltages between 6V and 24V as *"Your Call."*  Depending upon who you ask &#151; the camera or strobe manufacturers &#151; those strobes are acceptable or they are not.

The ISO spec doesn't really seem to hold a lot of weight!

<h2>The Strobe List</h2>

<div class="notice">
<p>The following list is based on either manufacturer specs or direct measurements (To measure the trigger voltage of your own strobe, follow the instructions <a href="https://www.botzilla.com/photo/g1strobe.html">here</a>).  If you can add to this list, <a href="mailto:strobes@botzilla.com">mail me</a> your numbers, along with a description of how you obtained them (measurement, from the web, from the manufacturer, etc).</p>

<p>While I have every reason to believe the information presented here is correct, I cannot be held responsible for the voltages coming from <i>your</i> flash equipment. Prudence is the purpose of this page!</p>

<h2><a name="lumedyne">Useful Info</a> From <a href="http://www.lumedyne.com">Lumedyne</a></h2>

<p><i>We got a very informative note from D.J. LaDez, the GM at <a href="http://www.lumedyne.com">Lumedyne Inc</a>:</i></p>

<p>You did not mention our Lumedyne flashes pre 1992 or so they had about 100volts with very low current.  The current was so low, batteryless slaves wouldn't power up.  Since 1992 we have used 12 volts with enough current to fire on all cameras and drive slave units.  We do not know of anyone, including Canon EOS users, who have had damage from the 12 volt sync output.</p>

<p>Also keep in mind that the severely low rating on the sync voltage is while using the hot shoe on the camera, however the PC on advanced models usually has a much higher rating ( I believe it's 250 volts).  Also keep in mind that product like our Sync Filter or the one I most often recommend is the Wein Safe Sync HS 6V.  It is a hot shoe to PC adapter and limits the voltage of anything to 6 volts to the camera.  Our Sync Filter is the #088E and is household to household connection for the same voltage but not at the camera, rather at the flash end when a household sync connection is used.</p>

<i>Thanks DJ!</i>

<p><b>Warning:</b> Negative voltages or voltages over 250 V applied to the camera's sync terminal could not only prevent normal operation, but may damage the sync circuit of the camera or flash. Check with the strobe manufacturer for voltage specifications</p>
