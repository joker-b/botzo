Did it! Actually had time after 6PM to shoot something new for the midnight deadline of the <a href="http://www.genec.com/federico/salon/urlist.php?secth=32">streetphoto salon</a> (click-thru the pic).

I still dug through the archives, and added a little alternate gleaned from last fall's trip to <a href="/photo/T2002/">Tokyo.</a> I like that one, but frankly it's something of an urban cliche. Still, the full set has quite a number of similar shots, with the hope that as a set they're stronger.
