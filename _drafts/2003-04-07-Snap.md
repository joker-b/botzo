<i>Tmax 100 TMX, Rodinal 1::50, 13 mins.</i>

Ran some TMX through Rodinal just before running down to Vegas. As I was running it I was digging through the web looking for references &#151; found nothing but bad things about this combination. Beats me why &#151; the result has a lot of that same Acro-like snap, and terrific tones. A <i>little</i> grainy-grittier? Yeah, but at the degrees of enlargement it takes to see the grain, who cares?

The German/English NAB-Issue <a href="http://www.zeiss.de/de/photo/home_e.nsf/Contents-FrameDHTML/B04079BFC75477C8C1256CED0054968E">Zeiss Camera-Lens News</a> just published their latest suite of film tests &#151; TMax 100, at 180 lpmm, was the finest-detailed of any available film in their test, even finer than Velvia. Not sure what developer was used &#151; probably TMax developer, but that was the one major undocumented factor.
