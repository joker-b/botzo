I mentioned a few organizational changes <a href="/blog/archives/000413.html">a few days ago.</a> While I <i>have</i> changed the <a href="/blog/archives.html">Links+Archives</a> page layout somewhat, that's not it. The changes are in the organization of my life.

The levees are breached &#151; eight years in the building but quick in the tearing-down; the surge overwhelming everything in its path, and I'm spending my days at the center of an org chart composed of just one single raft-like box, the waves bouying me up and down between anger and anguish. No stars, no chart, and no one to row and man the pumps but me and my one remaining arm.

Most lives are relatively simple, we move from day to day,  experiencing and building and sharing with the people closest to us, hand in hand til the end. We find meaning in what we make of it, and there's no thought or plan or action that's not some part of that whole. Or, instead,  find ourselves alone &#151;  instead of looking forward to the unknowns of life we feel like we're just passing time until it's our turn to blink out in some moment of unnoticed anonymous erasure. Maybe that's all anyone ever really gets, and the rest is simplistic illusion [Insert pollyanish aphorisms and Kubler-Ross quotes here]. 

I'm reminded of the story of Katrina Van Tassel, recounted again in <cite>The Dead Zone</cite> by Johnny Smith on the disappearance of Ichabod Crane: <i>"As he was a bachelor, and in nobody's debt, nobody troubled his head any more about him."</i> Nice and neat.

So yes, I <i>did</i> consider altering the layout and CSS for the site. But today, it's already about as black as I can make it.
