Thanks very much Rob! Yes for "Liquidity' style pictures the camera handling boils down to practice practice practice (and to a degree, a willingness to risk occasional personal injury) -- I started making photos with a similar look back in my film days. It doesn't work for all subjects (or cameras) but it suits my current environment. Beyond that it's the usual suite of street photo considerations: looking for interesting faces, gestures, and connections.

I look for gesture and connection & then run straight at it. So far few injuries have occurred.

I usually use wide lenses but not always, mostly digital but not always. 

My techniques develop from doing more than trying to explain, so they are hard to describe but if I were to try to self-analyze, I guess I come from working in cinema and thinking about how motion over time works one way in cine and a different way in still photography and trying to grasp at qualities of both. I do try to compose overall a motion shot, then just keep the shutter open during that shot to make a blurred still. I suppose this is not unlike Sugimoto's famous movie theatre, in some ways. I've tried different approaches too, like just combining lots of frames in-camera (recently made popular by Idris Khan, tho he uses the darkroom to do it), mixing-in strobe, etc. Just looking for a photography that is more like my haphazard sense of attention.

These photos are always in focus, btw :)
