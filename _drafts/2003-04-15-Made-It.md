Got the $#!! tax papers done, no need to file extensions or wait for the later deadlines. This year's return ran 28 pages, oy. Had to do long forms for US, California, and Hawaii. It's also the last-ever year I'll have to report alimony payments, so just for that reason <i>alone</i> &#151; hurrah.

In the end, I reported zero on the moving expenses &#151; maybe I'll send a revised return later, but even without them all the results ended up in the plus column.  Could there be a <a href="http://web.canon.jp/Imaging/EOS1DS/">D1s</a> in my near future?

Not!
