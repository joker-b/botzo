<i>It's a hard simple fact for travelers above the 40th parallel: in the depth of winter, the temerature is sure to descend quickly if the furnace isn't running.</i> This is the sort of sentence that has been historically difficult for even the best computerized language bots, both of the kind that attempt to understand human language and those that try to emulate it. The simple sentence has a range of different embodiments that map physical attributes to completely different physical or non-physical attributes. Why does a furnace "run," and what defines the "hardness" of a fact? Are seasons shallow as well as deep? How did our language get to be like this, and why is it so easy for you or I to understand?

To get a grasp on a possible chain of answers, I'll ask you to let your mind wander back to the earliest days of language and what we can image as human-like gesture. There are many non-human animals that communicate with gesture, such as fish that raise their fins and spines when challenging one another over territory. A credible evolutionary narrative is pretty simple to imagine: the fish that can best ward off rivals without actually having to risk combat is more likely to enjoy the benefits of the wider territory and over time more likely to win the survival and gene pool games.

What we see in hominids is a more complex behavior: a social use of communication. This character is shared with a few other animals, like a single prairie dog chirping a warning to the rest of the colony: predators may be nearby. Or at a higher degree of descriptiveness, a honeybee's shaking dance that replays their successful hunt for food, so that other bees can extract more nectar from the same source.

What the bee's dance shares with much human communication is a _symbolic mapping:_ the physical experience of flying to the right twenty meters then turning 15 degrees and continuing for fifty more can be re-expressed as wiggle-wobble-vibrate-wobble-wobble and that information is directly equivalent to repeating the experience. Other bees who see and understand the dance can also make the same flight without further guidance.

Early hominid communication probably shared this idea of connecting experience with description, but it also needed more: hunting groups, whether wolves or homonids, use communication of coordinate themselves in a speculative manner. The huntmaster may gesture _go that way_ not because they have gone there and found deer but because they're speculating that it will lead the the group having a successful hunt. Ancient hunters may have had a learned playbook, not unlike a bee, but their patterns could be deployed more flexibly.

Evolution also gave us a new tool for expression: the hand.

Other mammals use their forepaws for a few simple interactions, mostly in fights or hugs. Some have sophisticated dexterity, like raccoons. Hominids go a lot farther. As our ancestors were forced by their environment to stand upright, not only did their musculature and skeletons change to the circumstances, but the entire layout of shoulders and hands underwent changes that have left us very different, from the shoulders to the fingertips, from any remaining ape cousins.

It's been theorized that anatomical changes in the arms are some of the earliest signs that our bodies have been chnaged by our technologies. In particular, the human arm is great at _throwing._ No ape has a shoulder than can throw overhand (chimps can barely roll a tennis ball in a lurching underhand). Overhand throws, on the open plains or a softball match, are simply a lot more powerful. A thrown rock can drive off a leopard or take down an antelope, both animals humans had no chance against bare-handed. And just like the threatening fish, those hominids that could eat more and avoid being eaten longer were more likely winners of the evolutionary game.

It's not hard to see a connection between the end of a throwing gesture and one of our core communicative ones: the outstretched arm saying _over there._ A communication that follows out to the fingertips and beyond, out of the self and into the larger world.

In tall grass or when crouching, arm and hand signalling can be both more complex than that between members of a prey-animal herd, and nearly silent. New signals and tactics could be learned and refined over months, short-cutting evolutionary change in other creatures, Our communications dominance has never been challenged.

Hunting wasn't the only activity, and even as human limbs were changing so too were our mouths -- especially after the advent of fire, which made everyday foods easier to chew. Hominid volcalization machinery improved too, and for both gestural and vocal communications, a growing brain.

Jumping forward through time for a moment, in the past decade it's been shown that speech and communicative gestures are <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/106/49/20664.short">processed by the same brain areas.</a> Leaping back to our proto-humans, their improving hands and tongues were evolving in close tandem with more human-like speech centers. So close that as the NIH scientists would discover millenia later, the interior response for seeing a gesture like a finger over the lips to indicate quiet was essentialy identical to that from hearing a whispered "shhhh."

This ability gave pre-humans a deeply different way to communicate: it could follow multiple modes. Inside their heads a little dictionary could operate, explaining gestures as sounds and sounds as gestures and both as information to be acted upon.

In both cases, to speak or to gesture is to engage your muscles in a symbolic way, connected to some level of idea, and to use these symbolcs, alone or in sequence, to engender and build a parallel copy of that same idea in the mind of someone else. The temporality of information is often forgotten, though in fact there's a whole brain area dedicated to the processing of prosody, of how tone and timing affect language: a classic English example might be the difference between "we already ate, Grandma" versus a version lacking the comma.

Muscles, motion, and memory all began to connect in those ealy human-like brains. The cells used by our ancestors, like our own, often stored new memories about places and things in a layout along sheet of memory cells that, from a modern viewpoint, often looks a little like a cartoony map. Memories about neighboring paces are often stored in cells nearby one another, while places farther away are separate. The time it takes to connect ideas that are connected to different locations is often analogous to travel.

We see the connection between memory and location all the time. Can't remember the name of someone you see rarely? Recalling the location where you last saw them can often give memory a jolt. Think of an old friend. Does the memory come along with the recollection of some location?

It's in this connection between idea and gesture that change probably came to be expressed as motion. Just as change in position over time is expressed as direction -- _we walked over that way_ -- changes in other more abstract, maybe invisible qualities could be expressed as movement -- _the warmth of the air went up._

At some point gesture added drawing. The gestures one might use to describe a long journey over a tall hill are not that different from those used to draw a simple scene of the journey. A circling gesture to indicate family. a line to indicate direction, waving hands to indicate water -- they all have close parallels in drawing gestures, of following the energy of an idea and re-animating it.

The big difference, of course, is that a drawn gesture is now a persistent _object._ The listener may actually get the story on another day, or multiple , without the person who made that object being present. The receiver of the message -- the _viewer_ -- could copy it. Color it. If a line could represent a journey, maybe it could show what kinds of animal were found at the end of it. What might happen with them. Who went on the trip.

The ever more ornate permutations were paralleled in sound, of course -- in song and then through musical instruments (there are flutes nearly as old as the cave paintings of Lascaux). Gesture mixed with music, of course, is dance, while speech mixed with drawing is writing.

All of them connect physicality to both the expression and comprehension of ideas. Even the most inert concertgoer or reader is moving mentally, ideas building and bridging between paragraphs or _passionato._

That is, until photography.

Photography removes the hand from visual expression. The same little squeeze of a button is used to record ducks at the pond or the rubble left by an airstrike. The the _viewer,_ many of the same image idioms still apply: color, line, composition in classical terms. But the mechanism of creation has been disconnected, or moved to more-abstract levels: lighting, costumes, wind machines, Photoshop.

In the aftermath of 1850, of course we get reactions from painters, who would prefer to say that photography "freed" them, rather than relegated them to the margins: Impressionists, Abstract Expressionists, Dadaists, or Conceptual Artists of every stripe (many of whom gave in to use photography, often as a medium to record themselves creating gestures to drive the images' ideas). Only in recent years has painting seemed to be coming back from its century of fitful dreams to reassert its ability to connect seeing and time and gesture onto a canvas again, to let the painter tell a story through poetic means without feeling the need to either meticulously recreate the static appearance of a thing or to run away from representation as somehow "untrue."

The use of moveable type began a similar slide away from the personal in the written word, which was often no longer written at all. Printing was at first expensive, and that lent its uniformity authority. So too the later typewriter, which began a democratization of written presentation that has lead to the laser writer (no "type" to be moved) and the screen (no object to carry - no ink to page, nor pen to paper). The banishment of the hand is nearly complete.

And yet...
