I'll let you Google it yourself: Prince's 2010 interview where he declared "the internet is completely over."

As far back as the original Botzilla "about" page, some 25 years ago, it was clear that web links fargment the sentences they're attached to, pull and break the threads of ideas. So I won't link this page to that published interview at _The Mirror._ Not only to preserve the fraying thread of text, but also because in truth, it's no longer to link directly to it.

On the current web, the most I can do is provide a link that will lead a reader to a _Mirror_-related server that in turn will decide how much of the originally-intended information, _if any,_ to be shown. More likely, you will just be fed The Poison: alternative memes that have found ways to insert themselves into the traffic. When I last attempted to visit the decade-old interview page, first I had to answer questions on a survey about California Rela Estate prices, not signed by the _Mirror_ but by Google, pass through _two_ tiers of GDPR-related cookie authorisations, have the content covered by an ad apparently related to recent Amazon browsing though credited to another third party (Ad Junkie?), before landing not on the story I sought but a different one written years later after the singer's death, with an unlinked mention of the information I'd allegedly linked to.

In a clarification around 2015, Prince said his comment was not about "The Internet" in all broad strokes but simply about it as a channel for selling recordings. That it was not really a means for making money that expanded the methods used by the previous generations of record, tape, and CD sales. And for him, and many ortists from that era, he was right.

But from my window here in 2020, it looks like he was right about "The Internet," too.

The early expectations, where anyone who had some ideas and a keyboard could bring their ideas to the public sphere, are now little more than a wistfully-recalled naive joke. Personal blogs? Gone, replaced by social-media feeds that are as controlled as the cattle passing between fences in the stockyard. Even larger "personal" projects have been absorbed into aggregators like Medium. And everywhere, even on the skins of the few remaining personal sites, is The Poison.
