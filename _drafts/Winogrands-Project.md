Garry Winograndâ€™s John Simon Guggenheim Grant Statement, 1964

I look at the pictures I have done up to now, and they make me feel that who we are and how we feel and what is to become of us just doesnâ€™t matter. Our aspirations and successes have been cheap and petty. I read the newspapers, the columnists, some books, I look at some magazines [our press]. They all deal in illusions and fantasies. I can only conclude that we have lost ourselves, and that the bomb may finish the job permanently, and it just doesnâ€™t matter, we have not loved life.

I cannot accept my conclusions, and so I must continue this photographic investigation further and deeper. This is my project
