Every weekend I tell myself I'm going to see the <a href="http://www.monetinnormandy.org/">Legion of Honor Monet Show,</a> and every weekend: <i>not.</i>

I awoke this morning at 9AM with the same intent and it's already 1:30. It's an hour drive & I need a shower. Instead I've been scanning negs, watching vids, listening to podcasts, and the next thing I know... not that it's been time ill-spent! And later-on I've got a new bit of company: a boxful of <a href="/blog/archives/000503.html">back issues of <i>Private</i></a> were delivered last night, <i>fotografie e surrealismi in bianco e nero.</i> Still unopened.

"Monet in Normandy" ends next Sunday so the pressure will be on. This coming week promises to be a busy one, with art and technology <a href="http://upcoming.org/user/16474/">events</a> scheduled for every night but Monday. Next Saturday will have to be focused on getting out early, taking the kids, and heading not only to the Legion but also the <a href="http://www.sfmoma.org/">SFMOMA</a> Weston/Modotti show and making one of my periodic pilgrimages to 49 Geary and its stack of good revolving exhibitions. Gotta beat contemporary art into 'em while they're young, I say.
