The March edition of the UK mag <a href="http://www.gmcmags.com/">Black &amp; White Photography</a> has an interesting statistic &#151; both Kodak and Ilford reported their 2002 black and white film sales had <i>increased</i> over 2001 &#151; that both Kodak and Ilford were at a loss to explain why.

My guess &#151; cameras have deeply invaded the low ground, people taking snaps of Edgar &amp; Martha visiting the grandkids, and the expensive high end of journalism and advertising, where quick turnaround and color are at a premium. But the B&W market remains pretty unaffected, for examply the reasons I've stated before &#151; light, affordable cameras are clunky, the fast, useful ones are too expensive and heavy. For the folks who were doing B&W before the digital onslaught, there's really a minimal reason to change.

Don't get me wrong here &#151; <a href="http://www.photo.net/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=003EuS">rabid anti-digital sentiments</a> found in magazines like <a href="http://www.bandwmag.com/">B&amp;W</a> are comical &#151; this rise in B&W film use doesn't seem that inexplicable.
