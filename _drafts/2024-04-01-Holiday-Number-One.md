It's winter: time to work on the summer crops. I'm participating in this June's Sonoma-wide [_Art at the Source 2024_](https://www.artatthesource.org/), and will be documenting the many changes required to my projects, printing process, book-making, billing, website, advertising, etc. that are needed for that event.

Depending on the results, consider it either a how-to or how-not-to series.

I'm doing this work in concert with other Sonoma artists, most-notably [See See](https://seeseelo.com) but also my studio sponsor [Barbara Harris,](https://www.instagram.com/barbaraharris_designs/) who will be providing studio display space in Sebastopol -- there will also be a salon show at the [Sebastopol Center for the Arts](https://www.sebarts.org/), just a few blocks away from that dedicated display.

Early days! See you at Studio 16B on June 1st.
