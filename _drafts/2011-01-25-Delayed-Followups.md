If it hasn't been made clear from posts like <a href="http://www.botzilla.com/blog/archives/000683.html">this one,</i> I left the NVIDIA marketing group some time ago to pursue more media-production opportunities at <a href="http://www.trionworlds.com/">Trion Worlds.</a> We're just about to launch our first game title, <a href="http://www.riftgame.com/">RIFT.</a>

I though I'd take this entry to link backwards to some of the graphics presentations that I created at NVIDIA, some of which were mentioned <a href="http://www.botzilla.com/blog/archives/000651.html">here</a> and elsewhere, and which can still be found on NVIDIA's developer site or the sites of trade events like XNA Gamefest and GDC (Game Developers Conference).
