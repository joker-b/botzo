The new war in Iraq has given us the chance to see some hot news stories that our keenly-suspicious eye might've not otherwise caught. No, not about <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2002/05/bowden.htm">Saddam</a> or <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/iraq/view/">Bush</a> but about the <i>real</i> force in the Gulf: the treacherous <a href="http://www.albawaba.com/news/index.php3?sid=242849&lang=e&dir=news">invisible forces</a> that control life across the globe from the shadows. Thank goodness for a <a href="http://www.ateg.org/conferences/c6/salih.htm">literate society</a> where the <a href="http://www.rsf.org/">free press</a> can get these important issues out in the open. Personally, I suspect the war isn't truly about WMD or liberation at all &#151; are just TV-friendly canards. It's just a cover-up to keep the media busy so that the truly important stories are drowned-out and ignored.
