Saturday is the <a href="http://www.photofair.com/">Santa Clara Photo Fair</a> &#151; I haven't been to a collector-centric swapmeety show for years, so I'll be checking it out. Not that I really want to buy anything, and I've already made one swell photo purchase this week &#151; a secondhand copy of Gibson's <a href="http://www.ralphgibson.com/main.html"><cite>Light Years.</cite></a>

Hey, you never know. Maybe somebody'll sell me a nice Fuji GW 670 for $250... it <i>could</i> happen!

Wednesday night was the last Squirt-League roller hockey game for the regular season. As usual I was there shooting, as were several other parents. Sport still manages to bring out the parents with their film SLRs and impressively-heavy tele zoom lenses &#151; nary a digicam in sight, save for mini-DV's. Ever the contrarian, I brought the 28mm and my own skates for mobility.
