<p>I had no idea how many <a title="The Raving Atheist" href="http://ravingatheist.com/">atheist blogs</a> there were. I've no doubt there numbers are dwarfed by religious sites of every brand, but it's encouraging to see a number of voices out there.</p>

<p>Then again, if there are enough of either stripe then I suppose they can all blogroll each other and never notice the other world's existence... is this a good thing?</p>
