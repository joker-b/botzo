In the early 2000's I'd started making photos of art museum parking lots or other transport options. A catalog, not a typology. I was interested in the idea of checklist-destination travel _Ã  la_ Disneyland/Universal/Knotts: we take the family to Oslo and see the Ibsen museum, the Munch Museum, Opera House, National Museum, eat a little _ost_ and get a snap of the group in front of the palace, then back to the airport in two days.

For American museum destinations, as with Disneyland, museum travel nearly always involves parking.

In more recent days, the idea of museum as Instragram location has grown to parallel the Kodak Picture Spot. It's fascinating to watch as curators find ways to accomodate the standard online tropes.

Okay blah blah blah

museum as church
