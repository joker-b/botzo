In the early 2000's I'd started making photos of art museum parking lots and transport options. I was interested in the idea checklist travel: we go to Oslo and see this, that, the other, back to the airport in two days. For American destinations, museum travel nearly always involves parking.

In more recent days, the idea of museum as Instragram location has grown to parallel the Kodak Picture Spot. It's fascinating to watch as curators find ways to accomodate the standard online tropes.
