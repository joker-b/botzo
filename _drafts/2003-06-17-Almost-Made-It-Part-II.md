Spending this morning putting the last touches on my taxes, <a href="/blog/archives/000034.html">almost filed</a> months ago. Had to wait until now to get a response back. Oops. Forgot my W-2's and discovered to my dismay that I'm subject to AMT as well. So adios, big fat refund (leaving behind a rather more-svelte refund).

Also waiting by the mailbox for the latest Contax-G <a href="http://www.contaxg.com/document.php?id=9335" target="inkframe">print exchange,</a> even as I've signed-up for the <a href="http://www.contaxg.com/document.php?id=10686">next print exchange.</a> Only this time, I actually know what I'm sending, well-before the September (!) deadline.

If there's any time left after that stuff and getting into the office (long day today, stretching into the evening and up to San Francisco), I hope to fix some of the whacked formatting I left behind on the site while enabling a <a href="/blog/archives.html">links and journal archive page</a> yesterday. My apologies if everything looks whacked today... totally screwing-up your site is a <i>great</i> way to learn CSS, I hear.
