The first roll of film through this camera was a revelation, even before I'd printed a single frame. Then, as now, I liked to do my own black and white processing. I remember raising the uncut negatives to the light for a quick once-over view. I hadn't really expected to see much more than if they were properly exposed. What I was surprised to immediately see was the pop: crisp razored contrastiness of the frames, depth and clarity, even in the neg. I knew the Zeiss lenses would be good, but hadn't anticipated that they'd leave all other 35mm glass so far behind.

That was 1997. I am the original owner of this camera. It had been out for about a year when I purchased it. I still have the boxes, which is admittedly silly since I have no intention to ever sell it.

With a few pauses, my G2 has been operating for almost 25 years, all over America, Europe, and East Asia. Sometimes alone, often accompanied by other cameras.

The Contax rarely travels now, less due to the pandemic and more due to the hassle of air travel with any kind of film camera. As I type this I'm above the Pacific, headed west from California. The Contax is not with me but the 90mm Tessar is in my bag with a Fuji adapter. It's a fraction the size &amp; weight of Fuji's native 90mm f/2 and I don't miss the extra stop of light.

This post will therefore cover both the G2 itself, and also a bit about the continuing life of the G and G lenses among other cameras, here in the twilight age of film.

# It's the Focus

The G2 lenses are as good as any primes you'll ever find for 35mm format. Sharp, deep, well-immune to flare. They're also small: for quite a while my habit has been to forego a camera bag and just wear a raincoat or hunting jacket, the pockets loaded with extra film rolls and two of the "core trio" lenses, with the other one on the G2. My core trio is the stock one: 28, 45, 90mm. The 90 swapped on occasion with a borrowed 21mm f/2.8 (I eventually bought one -- easily a match for the 21mm Leitz offerings, at less than a quarter of the price).

None of this lens quality matters if the shot's out of focus, and struggles with G2 focusing appear to be the most common reason photographers abandon Contax for some other film camera. Reading and listening to stories about these struggles, it appears that they can be usefully divided between what I think of as two mostly-distinct sets of G users: those who want see the system as the most illustrious and titanium-beautiful point-and-shoot ever made, in the spirit of Contax's famed T compacts; and those who want a modernized but precise tool, an automatic-if-needed Zeiss-eyed camera in the spirit of Leica M (or Zeiss ZM).

We could call the opposing-extreme users along this axis: at one end Type <b>A-for-Aesthetic,</b> and at the opposite end: Type <b>Z-for-Carl (Zeiss).</b> 

The many cameras made in the 20 years after the G have spoiled us all, more than a little. Celphone cameras are always in focus, and often work in very low light. The mechanics of picture-making can be entirely concealed.

Autofocus on any digital camera has a phenomenological advantage over the G: instant feedback. When a digital misses focus, you know right away. If a non-SLR film camera misses autofocus, you don't know until the lab work is done.

A pure Type-A user can find themselves annoyed at the consequences of Type-Z realities. Shouldn't point-and-shoot cameras just... work?

The focusing demands for simpler, fixed-lens point and shoot cameras like the T series may actually give you _more_ useable photos that what you'll get from the G2. Doubly so if you are using a built-in flash. Type-Z explanation: a Yashica T4's 35mm lens, wide open at f/3.5, has about three times the depth of fiels as a G2's 90mm wide-open -- that is, the G needs to be three times as precise.

The fact that autofocus works _at all_ impresses me a lot. For a camera with Type-Z tendencies like the G, even more so. Modern cameras and celphones, with all their sophistication, often miss on "critical" focus ranges. I just snapped a photo of an in-flight snack using a Pixel phone. Or rather, I snapped two photos, because the first one was completely out of focus -- the little computer decided to focus on the seats in the opposite aisle. But: it's digital. Instant feedback -- I can see that the shot was blown, and know to shoot another. Ah, airline pretzels.

Meanwhile, Type-Z folks may have learned that the G's manual-focus dial is a puzzle or a disappointment compared to the reliable precision of the dial on old mechanical Contaxes or the lever on a Leica. Even worse for type Z, the Contax is exclusively a "focus by wire" camera: no direct mechanics between the focus wheel and the lens, so "focus by feel" - even with the camera turned off -- is just impossible.

G lenses have a unique way to move the lens elements around during focusing -- rather than a motor in the lens, the body pushes the elements in and out. The positive consequences of this design include smaller lenses and (probably) better battery efficiency. One of a few downsides is that there's no sensible way for the camera to show a depth-of-field indicator (later digital cameras attack this problem by using electronic connections to the lens aperture (if it's even controllable by the user) and putting the indicator on-screen: a G has no such screen, only a small LCD that's not coupled to the f/stop ring), even on the lens.

Lack of DoF markings for the lenses further defeats a Type-Z street shooter's popular strategy: zone focusing. For a 35mm lens at f/8, where shoukd I pre-set manual focus? You won't get this information from the camera. For my own use, I printed a little chart showing hyperfocal distances for common lenses at all f/stops -- a type-Z shooter can read that at f/22 the 21mm focuses to 0.8m will be in focus from 0.4m to infinity. For shooters less amenable to optical math, this is an optical pain in the neck.

When the G focuses, the lens moves forward. When the focus is released, the lens returns to infinity. 

The answer for all types of determined G users, in almost every case and as I've written here before, is back-button focus.

# G Lenses Abroad

Adapting a G lens to another camera -- as long as the spacing between the sensor and the base of the lens is narrow enough (in Z-speak, "narrow flange distance"), is pretty easy and cheap. Mirrorless cameras like the Fuji and Sony are both available. And both work well with G glass.

The 35mm G lens is a fine full-manual normal-lens option for Fuji, and the 90mm, compared to Fuji's own automated offering, feels truly tiny. The primary size difference is solid glass, so the weight of the Fuji is greater than this comparison picture might lead you to believe.

## It's the Focus, Part 2?

Ironically, if you adapt a G lens to another camera (either by an adapter, or even, as some users have done, by completely replacing the focus mechanism and transforming a G lens into an M-mount lens), you've inadvertently solved the G camera's problematic lack of easy manual focusing. Not only are adapted lenses manually focused, they're _only_ manual focused -- the ring around the adapter drives gearing to spin the G lens' internal AF axle.

Metal hoods!

# Type Z and MTF

Because Zeiss is very much a Type-Z company (thank you for that, Zeiss!), they still publish data sheets and MTF charts for all the G lenses.

<dt>Lenses I've Used a Lot &amp; Will Happily Vouch For</dt>
<dd><a href="https://www.zeiss.com/content/dam/consumer-products/downloads/historical-products/photography/contax-g/en/datasheet-zeiss-biogon-2821-en.pdf">The 21mm</a> the lens is great, the shoe-mount finder... a little too retro-twee for my taste. Any 21mm finder should do the trick. A great thing about 21mm is that as a portrait lens, you can get in crazy-tight with it. Most folks I've seen using this lens go for the Grand Canyon landscape vista approach. I prefer it for street. Whatever digs your hole.</dd>
<dd><a href="https://www.zeiss.com/content/dam/consumer-products/downloads/historical-products/photography/contax-g/en/datasheet-zeiss-biogon-2828-en.pdf">The 28mm</a> was my go-to-lens for quite a long while. Tastes change, perhaps -- I noew usually grab the 35.</dd>
<dd><a href="https://www.zeiss.com/content/dam/consumer-products/downloads/historical-products/photography/contax-g/en/datasheet-zeiss-planar-235-en.pdf">The 35mm</a> people protest that this lens is no match for the Zeriss 45mm. Those people are, in general, idiots. This is a great optic and a rival to the Summicron.</dd>
<dd><a href="https://www.zeiss.com/content/dam/consumer-products/downloads/historical-products/photography/contax-g/en/datasheet-zeiss-planar-245-en.pdf">The 45mm</a> this lens is rightly lauded as, well, uber-sharp.</dd>
<dd><a href="https://www.zeiss.com/content/dam/consumer-products/downloads/historical-products/photography/contax-g/en/datasheet-zeiss-sonnar-2890-en.pdf">The 90mm</a> doesn't get used on my G as much as with my Fujis, these days. It's always been a bit on the outside, if only because my own style lends itself to close-in wide-angle photos. If I shot weddings in the 90's, that might have been different.</dd>
<dt>The Other Two</dt>
<dd><a href="https://www.zeiss.com/content/dam/consumer-products/downloads/historical-products/photography/contax-g/en/datasheet-zeiss-hologon-816-en.pdf">The 16mm</a> I borrowed one of these once. Kind of a chore to use. But hey, collectors: it's German.</dd>
<dd><a href="https://www.zeiss.com/content/dam/consumer-products/downloads/historical-products/photography/contax-g/en/datasheet-zeiss-vario-sonnar-35563570-en.pdf">The <b>Zoom</b> 35-70</a> "Because we can" is the laudable reason that this lens exists, but the execution never really seems to have gotten "there." This lens was a contemporary of old zooms like the Nikkor 43-86, likewise avoided by people who were interested in sharpness, good color, or a lack of distortion.</dd>

(Another blast from the past: in April 2021, I discovered that the UK Contax website is _still online,_ even though shuttered about fifteen years ago. Check it out <a href="https://www.contaxcameras.co.uk/_html/gseries/g2/g2specification.html">here.</a>)
