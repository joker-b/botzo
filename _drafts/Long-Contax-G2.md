I am the original owner of this camera. It had been out for about a year when I purchased it. I still have the boxes, which is admittedly silly since I have no intention to ever sell it.

With a few pauses, the camera's been operating for almost 25 years, all over America, Europe, and East Asia.

# Film Cameras: What Goes Bad

Nearly all film cameras available, at this point, are second-hand. Among those pre-owned treasures, even the "new" ones might be rather old. My Contax G2 was the last new-in-the-box 35mm camera I'll ever likely buy: purchased in 1995. My Bronica RF645, purchased in 2005, is already 16 years old. 

Cameras and watches have a lot in common. The mecahnics of opening and closing a shutter are much like the clockwork that drive a watch's second, minute, and hour hands.
