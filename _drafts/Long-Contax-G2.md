The first roll of film through this camera was a revelation even before I'd printed a single frame. Then as now I liked to do my own black and white processing. I remember raising the uncut negatives to the light for a quick once-over view. I hadn't really expected to see much more than if they were properly exposed. What I was surprised to immediately see was the crisp razored contrastiness of the frames, the depth and clarity, even in the neg. I knew the Zeiss lenses would be good, but hadn't anticipated that they'd leave all other 35mm glass so far behind.

I am the original owner of this camera. It had been out for about a year when I purchased it. I still have the boxes, which is admittedly silly since I have no intention to ever sell it.

With a few pauses, the camera's been operating for almost 25 years, all over America, Europe, and East Asia. Sometimes alone, often accompanied by other cameras.

The Contax rarely travels now, less due to the pandemic and more due to the hassle of air travel with any kind of film camera. As I type this I'm above the Pacific, headed west from California. The Contax is not with me but the 90mm Tessar is in my bag with a Fuji adapter. It's a quarter the size of the 90mm f/2 Fuji lens and I don't miss the extra stop of light. This post will cover both the G2 and a bit about its continuing life among other cameras in the twilight age of film.

# It's the Focus

The G2 lenses are as good as any primes you'll ever find for 35mm format. Sharp, deep, well-immune to flare. They're also small: for quite a while my habit has been to forego a camera bag and just wear a raincoat or hunting jacket, the pockets loaded with extra film rolls and two of the "core trio" lenses, with the other one on the G2. My core trio is the stock one: 28, 45, 90mm. The 90 swapped on occasion with a borrowed 21mm (I eventually bought one -- easily a match for the 21mm Super-Angulon prized by Leica shooters).

None of this matters if the shot's out of focus, and struggles with focusing appear to be the most common reason photographers abandon the G2 for another film camera. Reading and listening to stories about these struggles, it appears that they can be usefully divided between what I think of as two mostly-distinct sets of G users: those who want see the system as the most illustrious and titanium-beautiful point-and-shoot ever made, in the spirit of Contax's famed T compacts; and those who want a modernized but precise tool, an automatic-as-needed Zeiss-eyed camera in the spirit of Leica M.

We could call the opposing-extreme users along this axis type A-for-aesthetic, or type Z-for-Carl (Zeiss). 

The cameras made 20 years after the G have spoiled us all, more than a little. Celphone cameras are always in focus, and often in very low light. The mechanics of picture-making can be entirely concealed. Autofocus on any digital camera has a phenomenological advantage over the G: rapid feedback. When a digital misses focus, you know right away. If a non-SLR film camera misses autofocus, you don't know until the lab work is done.

A pure type-A user can find themselves annoyed at the consequences of type-Z realities: the focus demands for a simpler, fixed-lens point and shoot may actually give you _more_ useable photos that what you'll get from the G2. Even more so if you are using a built-in flash (Type-Z explanation: fixed-lens P&S cameras usually have a smaller, more-forgiving aperture, with a short focal length: a Contax T4 depth of field wide-open at f/4 is far more forgiving than that of a 90mm at f/2.8). The term "point-and-shoot" implies that you can do just that: find a subject, point, shoot. 

The fact that autofocus works _at all_ impresses me a lot. For a camera with type-Z tendencies like the G, even more so. Modern cameras and celphones, with all their sophistication, often miss on "critical" focus ranges. I just snapped a photo of an in-flight snack using a Pixel phone. Or rather, I snapped two photos, because the first one was completely out of focus -- the little computer decided to focus on the seats in the opposite aisle. But: it's digital. Instant feedback -- I can see that the shot was blown, and know to shoot another. Ah, airline pretzels.

Meanwhile, type-Z folks may have learned that the G's manual-focus dial is a puzzle or a disappointment compared to the reliable precision of the dial on old mechanical Contaxes or the lever on a Leica. Even worse for type Z, the Contax is exclusively a "focus by wire" camera: no direct mechanics between the focus wheel and the lens, so "focus by feel" - even with the camera turned off -- is just impossible.

G lenses have a unique way to move the lens elements around during focusing -- rather than a motor in the lens, the body pushes the elements in and out. The positive consequences of this design include smaller lenses and (probably) better battery efficiency. One of a few downsides is that there's no sensible way for the camera to show a depth-of-field indicator (later digital cameras attack this problem by using electronic connections to the lens aperture (if it's even controllable by the user) and putting the indicator on-screen: a G has no such screen, only a small LCD that's not coupled to the f/stop ring), even on the lens.

Lack of DoF markings for the lenses further defeats a type-Z street shooter's popular strategy: zone focusing. For a 35mm lens at f/8, where shoukd I pre-set manual focus? You won't get this information from the camera. For my own use, I printed a little chart showing hyperfocal distances for common lenses at all f/stops -- a type-Z shooter can read that at f/22 the 21mm focuses to 0.8m will be in focus from 0.4m to infinity. For shooters less amenable to optical math, this is an optical pain in the neck.

When the G focuses, the lens moves forward. When the focus is released, the lens returns to infinity. 

The answer for all types of determined G users, in almost every case and as I've written here before, is back-button focus.
