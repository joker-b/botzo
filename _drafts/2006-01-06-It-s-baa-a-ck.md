So Canon did it &#151; put Humpty Dumpty back on the wall. The digital Cantax has <a href="http://www.botzilla.com/blog/archives/000440.html">returned,</a> with a new (quieter?) shutter and a repaired lens release mechanism too.

They removed every inch of gaffer tape from the camera (I had peeled back a lot before sending it in, but they were far more thorough). Surprisingly, however, they left the Russian "brain-transplant" software in place...

Guess I'll add re-taping to my to-do list. I've come to realize I've got quite a stack of recently-purchased and never-read books, including the Parr <cite>Photobook: A History</cite> which had been backordered for so long. <a href="http://www.martinparr.com/">Martin Parr</a> will be appearing here in San Francisco on the 24th &#151; I'd better get to reading!

All this and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=F9296971-F926-4BE5-9870-F6EE3B1977A3&displaylang=en">Iron Python,</a> <a href="http://www.macworldexpo.com/live/20/events/20SFO06A/">MacWorld,</a>   and <a href="http://electronicimaging.org/">EI 2006</a> in the next couple of weeks too! Guess it was good that I got out a little over the break because it looks like I'll be working, studying, and staying focused for a bit.
