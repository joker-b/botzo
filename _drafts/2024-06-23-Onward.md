Answerng some questions about my experience in the _Art at the Source 2024_ exhibition and open studio evet.

## Would I Do It Again?

Yes, I'm already signed-up and now preparing for _Art Trails 2024_ in October. This was my plan all along, really: do both a spring and autumn event, one as a complete naif and the next as a nearly-complete naif.

My space for _Art Trails_ will be different: in Petaluma, not Sebastopol, and not shared. Some learnings will apply, some won't:

Was it wrong not to frame at least one large paper print?

Co-location with Barbara meant female browsers. Books got browsed too.

Sevral male photographers showed up, told me off.

Someone was really steamed about the gun kid pic and I never found out who or why.

Ignored Instagram -- again, "the photographer problem." Photographers don't buy photography.

Small books versus big books.

Long good chats.

No one visits the gallery, they follow the catalog or the signs.

No artists see other artists except at the reception.

_(On the final Saturday of Art at the Source, Santa Rosa's "Peggy Sue Cruise" will occur. I'll find a way to be there, but: don't ask me for free books that day, heh. Too late!)_  -- giveaways

Book printing -- how to keep costs under control?

## The "Dancing Oops"

Reprint!




## Many Kinds of Tasks

Tasks that still remain over the next week+:

* Still no video: I've produced other artists' video, but haven't had time for my own. I have sketches and scripts and zero hours to use them.
* Accounting for online payments and ordering. Also, a paper receipt book for that old-fashioned physical currency.
* No time will be spent offering NFT's. Sorry.
* Signage: Not only the "Official" signage, but signage within the studio/exhibit space.
* Paperwork for the follow-on "Art Trails 2024" event, off in October (and in a different location)
* No robots will be present. It had been considered. Next time.
* Post-Event Plans: storage and placement of unsold items, follow-on sales, additional retail opportunities that have been waiting until AatS, etc. The show never ends.

*The Text:*

> Our family are growers, inventors, explorers.
> Dad was raised on a horse-powered farm, yet by 35 his navigation designs landed people safely on the moon. Some of his excited curiosity and Mom’s typewriter came with me to art school. Since then I’ve explored new ways to make images, built tools for artists and teams to create new meanings and experiences, and of course to share with the world. Along the way I’ve collected awards and patents for films, cameras, games, theme park rides, books – all of them driven by the questions “What if?” and “then what?” and a drive to discover: “what would it feel like?”
> Alongside the collaborations with clients and corporations, my personal explorations have always continued. By camera, computer, or both: always curious.
> If you love seeing what’s over the next hill, please come by the studio in Sebastopol. It’s on Harrison St, up behind Rotten Robbie’s, a garden near the hiking trail. The prints and related books I’m sharing for Art at the Source this year reflect some of my ongoing delight in what can be coaxed from glass, metal, and an occasional spark.
