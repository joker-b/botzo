Answerng some questions about my experience in the _Art at the Source 2024_ exhibition and open studio evet.

## Would I Do It Again?

Yes, I'm already signed-up and now preparing for _Art Trails 2024_ in October. This was my plan all along, really: do both a spring and autumn event, one as a complete naif and the next as a nearly-complete naif.

My space for _Art Trails_ will be different: in Petaluma, not Sebastopol, and not shared. Some learnings will apply, some won't. Some were expected, some were surprises:

## Expectations and Surprises

### Expected: Photographers Don't Buy Photography

(and more generally: artists don't buy art)

They just don't.

Film, lenses,  plugins, adapters, hard drives: sure. Photographs: nope.

I wrote a long opinionated rant about why this is. I'll save it for another post. Just trust me when I say this: photographers don't buy photography.

With that in mind, when I distributed my promo cards, while I did share a fair number at locations where photographers might be around to see them (e.g. camera stores), I also knew that people who had an interest in the _content_ of the work were more likely as an audience. The Giants fans might like to see photos of Giants fans. That book collectors might like books. That members of the Norcal Carshow scene might like to see photos that admire and celebrate themselves, their friends, the culture. 

With that in mind most of my promo efforts went to places I hoped might catch a few of those many people whose first words to me weren't likely to be "what was the shutter speed on this one?"

There was only a small, but measurable, benefit to this effort. The QR code on the promo cards is slightly different from the one in the catalog, so I'm able to know how some number of viewers came to my dedicated AatS page. There definitely were people who came from book fairs, who came from local event calendars. I can hope that occasionally yet other people will see some of the work and tell their friends.

### Nobody Really Knows Anything

My belief, going into the event, was that _Forogtten Signs,_ _Graffiti Generations,_ and work from the _Liquidity SF_ series: _CHAMPIONS_ and _Sooner or Later Someone's Going to Get Hurt_ -- would elicit the most interest and be the strongest sellers.

This was wrong.

People came into the Studio for several reasons:

1. They saw the index image (from _Liquidty SF_) in the catalog.
2. They saw the ad (which had _Forgotten Signs,_ _Grafitti Generations,_ _Liquidity_ and accidentally a series I didn't even show (!) called _Paperwork_) in the catalog.
3. They come to that same Studio location every year (it's my first year, but not Barbara's)
3. They saw an "Art at the Source" sign as they were driving by on Highway 116, which is a trunk road.
4. They saw an "Art at the Source" sign as they were on a walk along the very nearby Joe Rodotoa Trail.
5. They got a promo card, either psted or from some store, coffee shop, etc.
6. They were neighbors.
7. They were friends of mine.
8. They were friends of Barbara's.
9. They only came to see Barbara's studio, and actually had no interest in me or my work.
9. They saw _"The Two Algorithms of Life"_ at the SebArts Gallery and felt they needed to see what was going on over at Studio 16b.
10. They marked all the "photographer" entries in the catalog and visted them.
10. They marked all the "jewelery" entries and I was just... there.
11. They marked all the catalog map numbers in a certain area and visted them.
12. They are a +1 trailing along behind someone who has any of the above reasons.

None of these reasons are meant to align with whether or not someone will buy work, or even notice it, much less engage with the it enough to browse through the stacks or open a sample book.

_But some people did._ Which is what makes the effort worthwhile.

_Thank You._

Thank you to the people who deliberately sought out my pictures. Thanks to the people who didn't but found them and had to look. Thank you to the friends who sometimes made some pretty long drives to Sebastopol. Thank you to the people who hadn't expected to see pictures at all, and who ended up going home with them: on a print, in a book, or in their memory.

The work that attracted the most sales attention, by far, was _Dancing with No One._ Several prints sold, all of them the larger size, and of the two editions of the book I had on hand -- softcover or larger hardcover -- nearly all of the hardcovers sold. 

I'd made smaller prints, and smaller books, to smooth the on-ramp. In truth, people who really loved these pictures, the poetry of this project, didn't want a low on-ramp. They wanted whatever their budget would bear.

This is humbling in many ways.

Likewise, the larger and hardcover edition of _Forgotten Signs_ was prefered over the softcover. Those two projects were the ones with two editions, and basically, the nearly all the softcovers that moved out of the studio were ones bundled with an associateed print.

Every book sold at least one copy. I am thankful for that. But some: more.

 _Dancing with No One_ inspired conversations among visitors, paging through the books or racks, showing one another the prints, talking about the color or the flow. One visitor, browsing a book picture by picture, reached the end, then held it up for me to see, as if I'd never seen it before. She had to share? I was and still am very moved to have seen her reaction.

Yet the works that caused the largest conversations were the portraits from a project that hasn't yet been "booked." They're portraits of fictional characters, part of a long-running series that includes _RBF._ The one that got the most "conversational traction" is a portrait of an ambiguous-aged tattoed female character. Some people hated it, loudly, immediately. Others adored it, reacting in much the same way.

What was exciting to me was the fact that regardless of the valence, reactions were strong. People couldn't "figure it out," but had strong feelings.

Yet no one bought the print, alas. Maybe I should have had it on the wall, framed. Maybe I should have mentioned to people that if it caused so many conversations in this little studio, imagine what it could do in your restaurant, your sitting room.

I did not do these things. Maybe I should. Maybe not. But it was gratifying to be close to the reactions, immediate and in person. Credit card or not.





What about Gallery One?

Was it wrong not to frame at least one large paper print?

Co-location with Barbara meant female browsers. Books got browsed too.

Several male photographers showed up, told me off. "Are you the photographer?"

Someone was really steamed about the gun kid pic and I never found out who or why.

Ignored Instagram -- again, "the photographer problem." Photographers don't buy photography.

Small books versus big books.

Selfies with purchasers: why didn't I do this?????

Long good chats.

No one visits the gallery, they follow the catalog or the signs.

No artists see other artists except at the reception.

Portraits: people are unsure about them on teh wall, but they sure talked about them! Maybe that's why they should be in your living room.

_(On the final Saturday of Art at the Source, Santa Rosa's "Peggy Sue Cruise" will occur. I'll find a way to be there, but: don't ask me for free books that day, heh. Too late!)_  -- giveaways

Book printing -- how to keep costs under control?

## The "Dancing Oops"

Reprint!


Putting Stuff Away.....

## Many Kinds of Tasks

Tasks that still remain over the next week+:

* Still no video: I've produced other artists' video, but haven't had time for my own. I have sketches and scripts and zero hours to use them.
* Accounting for online payments and ordering. Also, a paper receipt book for that old-fashioned physical currency.
* No time will be spent offering NFT's. Sorry.
* Signage: Not only the "Official" signage, but signage within the studio/exhibit space.
* Paperwork for the follow-on "Art Trails 2024" event, off in October (and in a different location)
* No robots will be present. It had been considered. Next time.
* Post-Event Plans: storage and placement of unsold items, follow-on sales, additional retail opportunities that have been waiting until AatS, etc. The show never ends.

*The Text:*

> Our family are growers, inventors, explorers.
> Dad was raised on a horse-powered farm, yet by 35 his navigation designs landed people safely on the moon. Some of his excited curiosity and Mom’s typewriter came with me to art school. Since then I’ve explored new ways to make images, built tools for artists and teams to create new meanings and experiences, and of course to share with the world. Along the way I’ve collected awards and patents for films, cameras, games, theme park rides, books – all of them driven by the questions “What if?” and “then what?” and a drive to discover: “what would it feel like?”
> Alongside the collaborations with clients and corporations, my personal explorations have always continued. By camera, computer, or both: always curious.
> If you love seeing what’s over the next hill, please come by the studio in Sebastopol. It’s on Harrison St, up behind Rotten Robbie’s, a garden near the hiking trail. The prints and related books I’m sharing for Art at the Source this year reflect some of my ongoing delight in what can be coaxed from glass, metal, and an occasional spark.
