## After the Final Weekend, Before the Post-Mortem

The pace of the final days of preparation and weekends for [Art at the Source 2024]({{ site.url}}/aats) kept me away from these entries, so now, in teh final days before the artists and administrators gather for a final assessment for 2024, here are some reflections and ramblings on the experience at Studio 16B in Sebastopol.

## Prints, Formats, Pricing

Printing, matting, and wrapping consumed most of my free hours in the final days before June First. This was due in no small part to the demands I set myself for printing at least one print, and sometimes two for each of the sixty zodiacal animals from [_Forgotten Signs._]({{ site.url}}/signs) This included some of my favorite outtakes.

Many of these illustrations had been previously printed, but once I started using Canson's baryta paper, my desire bent on completing the set on it, and that meant the _entire_ set. It was worth the effort.

There were about seventy matted prints on display, in print stand racks. Each print, matted or not, was signed and edition-numbered with an archival Copic pen, and the matte or backing board was marked by hand with my studio stamp.

My longtime practice, when matting, is to make my own mounting corners from archival calligraphy paper, and attach them behind the aperture of the matte with an archival-friendly tape. For some formats, the corners are cut into an "L" shape, _kirigami_ style. For seventy prints this means 280 little origami-crane-like folded corners, made while binge-watching episodes of National Geographic's series [_Photographer._](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography/topic/photographer)

_Tip: Dan Winters._

Pricing is a torment for many artists. I knew I'd need a price list, and it would be madness to make it complicated.

As mentioned [last time,]({% post_url 2024-05-23-Opened %})) for prints made in the run-up to _AatS24,_ other than the one special main-gallery-only work [_The Two Algorithms of Life,_]({{ site.url}}/books/two) which was fabricated on a large sheet of phone-grade aluminum, I printed in only two "bands" of sizes: the "small" 8x10 band, matted to 11x14; and the "large" 16x20 band, matted to 18x24. Square variants are 8x8 or 12x12, mattted appropriately. Just two basic price choices: big or small.

(Metal prints were in "their own bands" of 24x36 and 30x45-inch sizes)

As a minor complication, and only for the smaller size and due to the large number of _Forgotten Signs_ prints: there were also un-matted prints, wrapped in a protective sleeve with a size-matched matte backing board for safety and structure. These were marked less expensively than the fully-matted size. There simply wasn't space in the Open-Studio environment to present them in the larger format.

Small prints are in editions of twenty, large in editions of eight. Thus far no single print has needed more than three copies.

I didn't frame any of these new prints: I'd already allocated the available wall space to some _Liquidity SF_ metal prints, and a handful of older framed works like my 2017 _History of the National Security Agency._ They were listed separately, along with the books, which each had their own price.

Therefore the price list:

PRICE LIST HERE

I made a simple pact with myself on the first day: I would not chnage the price list during the first weekend, and if I changed it for the second weekend, no price could go down.

## Space

The studio spaces are at the end of a driveway in Sebastopol. Visitors would usually enter in the front section, where I was showing, and proceed to the rear area where Barbara was displaying jewelry and her considerable supply of jewelry-making tools, supplies, and workspaces.

On one side of my studio space I set up display panels to add wall space while also protecting the walls. This gave me about sixteen total feet of wall for hanging three- and four-foot wide prints.

The print racks and a pedestal loaded with books were also below these wide prints. On the opposite side, which had windows and a door, a low cabinet had some portfolio books and catalog, some extra folios with images of failed experiments, test prints, and some space for visitor sign-in logs.

All book titles were bagged to keep them clean, but I kept out on marked "Studio Copy" for browsing.

Since it had come out only a few weeks earlier, I set to a copy of the latest _Shots_ magazine, which contained one of my photos. By coincidence, _Shots_ had reposted it again on their own Instagram account just two days before the open studio. Thanks!

## Reflections

Was it wrong not to frame at least one large paper print?

Co-location with Barbara meant female browsers. Books got browsed too.

Sevral male photographers showed up, told me off.

Someone was really steamed about the gun kid pic and I never found out who or why.

Ignored Instagram -- again, "the photographer problem." Photographers don't buy photography.

Small books versus big books.

Long good chats.

No one visits the gallery, they follow the catalog or the signs.

No artists see other artists except at the reception.

_(On the final Saturday of Art at the Source, Santa Rosa's "Peggy Sue Cruise" will occur. I'll find a way to be there, but: don't ask me for free books that day, heh. Too late!)_  -- giveaways

Book printing -- how to keep costs under control?

## The "Dancing Oops"

Reprint!




## More on Outtakes

There are two extra outtake pictures that I chose not to include in  _[RBF]({{ site.url}}/rbf)_ set. They'll only be available as larger prints.

There will also be a contest during show days -- the RBF cards are printed blank inside, but what would _you_ write, or want some future edition to include as text inside? There will be a notebook full of visitors' answers and people who contribute the funniest, most tragic, or both simultaneously will be sent some appreciatively grumpy freebies.

## Many Kinds of Pictures

While most of the prints to be offered during AatS are drawn from book projects like _Generations_ or [_The Caged Bouquet,_]({{ site.url}}/cage) there will be more, from unpublished projects like _The Collectors_ that haven't yet gelled into a book, or a few unaffiliated works like ["Anchor"]({% post_url 2024-04-23-Glimpse3 %}) which have proved to be popular over the past year.

## Many Kinds of Tasks

Tasks that still remain over the next week+:

* Still no video: I've produced other artists' video, but haven't had time for my own. I have sketches and scripts and zero hours to use them.
* Accounting for online payments and ordering. Also, a paper receipt book for that old-fashioned physical currency.
* No time will be spent offering NFT's. Sorry.
* Signage: Not only the "Official" signage, but signage within the studio/exhibit space.
* Build-out of the studio exhibit space: the panels are delivered, but unassembled and therefore prints are yet to be hung.
* Still need to make the "Folder" video to be shown in the studio (when you see it, you'll know).
* Paperwork for the follow-on "Art Trails 2024" event, off in October (and in a different location)
* Snacks.
* No robots will be present. It had been considered. Next time.
* Finish paperwork with the Library of Congress Copyright Office
* Website Shuffling: some new work, but no "Ghost" migration yet. And image grids may be broken again for Safari and some phones... hair to be pulled!
* Post-Event Plans: storage and placement of unsold items, follow-on sales, additional retail opportunities that have been waiting until AatS, etc. The show never ends.

*The Text:*

> Our family are growers, inventors, explorers.
> Dad was raised on a horse-powered farm, yet by 35 his navigation designs landed people safely on the moon. Some of his excited curiosity and Mom’s typewriter came with me to art school. Since then I’ve explored new ways to make images, built tools for artists and teams to create new meanings and experiences, and of course to share with the world. Along the way I’ve collected awards and patents for films, cameras, games, theme park rides, books – all of them driven by the questions “What if?” and “then what?” and a drive to discover: “what would it feel like?”
> Alongside the collaborations with clients and corporations, my personal explorations have always continued. By camera, computer, or both: always curious.
> If you love seeing what’s over the next hill, please come by the studio in Sebastopol. It’s on Harrison St, up behind Rotten Robbie’s, a garden near the hiking trail. The prints and related books I’m sharing for Art at the Source this year reflect some of my ongoing delight in what can be coaxed from glass, metal, and an occasional spark.
