I'm heading for Salt Lake City today to begin final jurying on sketches for Siggraph 2006. Lots of fine proposals this year, it's both tragic and exciting that the number of available venue slots is far smaller than the number of people submitting great ideas.

<a href="http://www.siggraph.org/s2006/main.php?f=conference&p=papers">Siggraph papers</a> have an earlier deadline and have already been chosen &#151; in fact you can find a number of them already at <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/~tor/sig2006.html">Brown University</a> and/or <a href="http://graphics.pixar.com/">Pixar.</a>
