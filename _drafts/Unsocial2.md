<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BPJUpRTAtij/">跑馬地</a> : Happy Valley Ding Ding

I've been taking <a href="https://courses.dotansaguy.com/">Dotan Saguy's Online Street Masterclass</a> over the past few weeks. While created as a covid-safe alternative to his usual <a href="https://leicaakademieusa.com/product/street-photography-in-depth-venice-beach-with-dotan-saguy-september-2021/">live Leica Akademie classes</a>, I hope he keeps the online edition going, too. It less immediate presence, but sometimes that slower pace is good, especially for someone slow, like me.

During an online discussion session, the topic of Instagram came along. Insta has been getting a fair bit of criticism from photographers lately, though I don't think it has really changed much.

Dotan is shooting a new project involving Bodie State Park, and had posted a couple of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CQwO679Le8G/k">his recent photos,</a> as part of his ongoing process. They were accompanied by some comments about social posting:

<blockquote><i>On my last shoot in Bodie on Monday I bumped into many photographers carrying lots of gear. One of them asked me where that famous old car was that people post so many photos of on Instagram. I told him where it might be but couldn’t help but think: Why? Why bring all this expensive photo gear and spend the day trying to recreate images that are already a dime a dozen on IG? Do me a favor next time you go out to shoot: don’t be that guy! Strive for something different. Something that adds to the conversation. Something that’s about YOU and how YOU see the world.</i></blockquote>

By coincidence, Dotan's post was just a day or two after a <i>New York Times</i> story: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/world/asia/china-staged-photo-shoots.html"><i>At This Instagram Hot Spot, All the World's a Stage (and the Buffalo's a Prop)</i></a> with photos by <a href="https://www.gsabrie.com/">Gilles Sabrié,</a> on the village life in China's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiapu_County">Xiapu County,</a> a place where traditional village life has been replaced by a social-media-ready pretend version on a scale that dwarfs anything dreamed by Kodak as a Picture Spot.

At Xiapu, the photographers are arranged by handlers, told the correct focal length, ordered to click on a ready signal barked from a bullhorn. The results are guaranteed to be lovely but also <i>openly guaranteed to be unoriginal.</i>

The <i>Times</i> story includes an aside about a photography teacher who had made more personally-distinctive photos in Xiapu -- photos which, when subsequently posted online, were criticized as a "wasted opportunity" to make sunset-orange photos just like those of the other fifty people squeezed onto the designated platform, piled up in the predefined spot and churning out identical exposures. Exposures that look just like the one on the billboard next to the predetermined picture spot.

The photo teacher's mistake is a common one. They think that a photography site is about photography. It's not, at least not about the "Big P" of photography. Sites like Instagram or WeChat Moments are <i>social</i> sites. They're about declaring your tribal affiliations. Making cliché statements is very nearly the entire game.

This has been true as long as personal photography existed, sure. There are many many photos of the Golden Gate Bridge, entirely gorgeous and dull except for the foreground, where your own kids are grimacing while shivering in the 30mph wind. It's a social declaration, regardless of whether the light's golden or gray.

On the distraction of social media

Not a retreat, a continuation.
