I've been busy tonight using Photoshop's "Automate" feature, running an action to add my rubber-stamp "bug" to photos in the <a href="/photo/F2003/">February sketchbook</a> and <a href="/photo/G1links.html">elsewhere</a> on the site.

A few years ago, I found a stock-photo house in Spain was selling <a href="/photo/Sampler/12.html">this photo,</a> found here on the site, without bothering to tell me (or pay me). After that incident, the stamp appeared. I got a lot of complaints, and in the past couple of months I had let many "bug-less" shots onto the web.

Sadly, my <a href="archives/000042.html">log robot</a> noticed a recent upsurge in picture theft &#151; people using photos from <a href="/">botzilla</a> on their own web pages (one even was from a site that was offering to sell the pix). And <a href="/photo/gp/D107-0793.html">this one</a> cropped-up in a German magazine last fall, and I still haven't been paid.

So while having a distracting rubber-stamp in unfun, being ripped off is even <i>more</i> unfun, and the stamps are back.
