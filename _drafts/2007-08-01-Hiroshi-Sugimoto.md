Finally made it to the Hiroshi Sugimoto show at the DeYoung Museum. I approached it with some trepidation, after my last encounter with his work at Fraenkel -- work that <a href="http://www.openphotographyforums.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2355">I felt then</a> was more an exercise in marketing. The work there was not <i>bad,</b> but... $80K/print?

While I've seen a lot of Sugimoto work in books, and a handful of prints at venues like SFMOMA, this was the first large grouping of his large prints that I've seen, shall we say, <i>in vivo.</i> The difference, even for "lifeless" subjects like his <a href="http://www.temple.edu/photo/photographers/hiroshi_sugimoto/portraits_gallery/pages/Yasser%20Arafat.htm">wax figure portraits,</a> is striking and not to be glossed-over. This was true of the work at Fraenkel too BTW -- at least for me, the strongest merit of those large prints came from very minute color variations in texture that would only be visible on that specific print -- not in book or least of all web form.
