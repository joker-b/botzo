At around 4AM on a cold morning in 2024 I discovered John Berger's 1974 recorded thoughts written upon reading Susan Sontag's 1977 book _On Photography._

Public and Private

Since that time, personal/private have been torn together. Not only in the popular social media forms but infine-art circles too, by artists like Nan Goldin, Wolfgang Tilmans, Nikki S. Lee, Cindy Sherman.

Self-portraits have long existed: Durer, Van Gogh, Rembrandt. But these were not their primary work. Personal, perhaps. But not The Work.

Berger listening. "Seamless connection fo the political and the personal." Tiny village, big city.

Wedding photos - a crossover form.

Eternity.

Sontag: "Movies and television programs light up walls, flicker, and go out; but with still photographs the image is also an object, lightweight, cheap to produce, easy to carry about, accumulate, store." but... they're not stored? http://www.susansontag.com/SusanSontag/books/onPhotographyExerpt.shtml
