# Notes from my calendar

* The Nature of Hierarchies (how nature likes them) -- this affects rendering, too: affect rendering, but really... are stories "data amplification" of higher-level truths, that need fine-detail narrative to be comprehensible? Is this true for narratives and art in general?

* New ways of seeing mean new ways of feeling - D. Hockney

* Cargo Cult Tasks -- make-work but more.

* media pic correctness -- media pictures have a "correct" description, "naturalness" usually, because it makes CREATORS interchangeable

* Art is an amplifier for the mind (feelings not only verbal thoughts... things that would be tooo quiet without art`)

* my travel-photo kit

* curvature in nature -- forces are never balanced, the three-body problem at every possible scale... tension and curvature - no straight lines

* faster than drawing -- Vince Glielmi, HCB, many people move from painting and drawing to photo because you can get what you want more quickly. Now AI.

* Consumption Communities

* Tehcnology that Enables Art -- paint in a tube, pianos, kodak....

* on... harebrains (?)

* PIER 24 FINAL SHOW

* Stories are Guided Dreams. ALl narratives, even goofy ones, are guided dreams

* It's difficult to draw even the worst photograph

* Azoulay is full of it -- clever but she commits the inevitable sin of thinking she can tell everyone else what THEY think, that she knows their motivations better than they do and there's no discussing it. What is she, Ayn Rand?

* photos help to remember, but in practice, they help to forget -- ignore your memeory

* visual neurons are the most common kind

* Instagram is boring

* Nancy History Story -- "Thousands and thousands of years ago when the early Christians were hiding from the Muslims and the Ottomans..."

* Churches are media companies

* Book process, video process (AATS)

* DOING TIME: Zettlekasten - what it LACKS

* Dream about Pat and a duck

* "To Those WHo Love Us:...." ...these are activities that destroy us, when shooting:
   * shopping
   * restaurants
   * selfies and shots of landmarks
   * carrying other people's things
   * having to keep track of other travelers
   * schedules
   * chit chat
   * holding hands
"owning a nice camera" is not a photographer, and that attitude is insulting

* New tools allow and create new feelings - That were not possible before- Tools, tools

* single shots - notebook 31 dec 23 - whateve it is I'm against it

* üëπ "yugen" üáØüáµ- https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/01/awe-wonder-and-the-overview-effect-how-feeling-small-gives-us-much-needed-perspective

* roads were taken from bikes by cars, not the other way around

* ALL THE WAY  ‚ÄúIf you're going to try, go all the way. There is no other feeling like that. You will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire. You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. It's the only good fight there is.‚Äù ‚Äî Charles Bukowski, Factotum

* FAIL ORIGINALLY - "It is better to fail in originality than to succeed in imitation." ‚Äî Herman Melville

* PORTRAITS IMPROVE OVER TIME - older portraits gain in value, unlike a haircut

* Mackendrick's Bear -- Sandy mckendrick bear baiting story and the dawn of the information economy

* THE MAIN THING<br/>The main thing is to make sure the main thing is the main thing

* You cannot optimize your way to innovation

* Engligh Light = English Food?<br/>üì∏ gray English light is like English food - bland enough to welcome anything. You wouldn't put marmite on spanish food, but you can on toast

* THE MEANING OF AI'S EXISTENCE<br/>humans worry about the meaning of their lives but an AI already knows it before it is even built and it's defined by a meaningless (?) human

* "Reality is always an open platform"

* Never write your headline first and try to make the facts fit

* To pose in a photograph is to ERASE the moment. A crime.

* SCOTOPIC RECAP<br/>Two senses shared eyeballs - take a stand!

* A BRIEF HISTORY OF WHO IS EXPECTED TO BE STUPID<br>american predjudices:<br/> once it was swedes<br/> or jews<br/> or blacks<br/> or poles<br/> or asians<br/> now it's a guy with a flag & maga hat<br/> tables have turned!
