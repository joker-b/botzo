# Notes from my calendar

* The Nature of Hierarchies (how nature likes them)

* Cargo Cult Tasks -- make-work but more.

* media pic correctness -- media pictures have a "correct" description, "naturalness" usually, because it makes CREATORS interchangeable

* Art is an amplifier for the mind (feelings not only verbal thoughts... things that would be tooo quiet without art`)

* my travel-photo kit

* curvature in nature -- forces are never balanced, the three-body problem at every possible scale... tension and curvature - no straight lines

* faster than drawing -- Vince Glielmi, HCB, many people move from painting and drawing to photo because you can get what you want more quickly. Now AI.

* Consumption Communities

* Tehcnology that Enables Art -- paint in a tube, pianos, kodak....

* on... harebrains (?)

* PIER 24 FINAL SHOW

* Stories are Guided Dreams. ALl narratives, even goofy ones, are guided dreams

* It's difficult to draw even the worst photograph

* Azoulay is full of it -- clever but she commits the inevitable sin of thinking she can tell everyone else what THEY think, that she knows their motivations better than they do and there's no discussing it. What is she, Ayn Rand?

* photos help to remember, but in practice, they help to forget -- ignore your memeory

* visual neurons are the most common kind

* Instagram is boring

* Nancy History Story -- "Thousands and thousands of years ago when the early Christians were hiding from the Muslims and the Ottomans..."

* Churches are media companies

* Scott Nichols Gallery -- Salgado inside, wineries in the sunset on the outside

* AI avoids talking down to you (?) -- I can explore kisch etc without being an outsider, without seeming to humiliate an idividual

* Admirable Monkeys -- Because monkey see monkey do -- So be selective of your monkeys

* Book process, video process (AATS)

* DOING TIME: Zettlekasten - what it LACKS

* Dream about Pat and a duck

* blog about gorup "salon" critiques

* "To Those WHo Love Us:...." ...these are activities that destroy us, when shooting:
   * shopping
   * restaurants
   * selfies and shots of landmarks
   * carrying other people's things
   * having to keep track of other travelers
   * schedules
   * chit chat
   * holding hands
"owning a nice camera" is not a photographer, and that attitude is insulting

* New tools allow and create new feelings - That were not possible before- Tools, tools

* single shots - notebook 31 dec 23 - whateve it is I'm against it

* üëπ "yugen" üáØüáµ- https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/01/awe-wonder-and-the-overview-effect-how-feeling-small-gives-us-much-needed-perspective

* roads were taken from bikes by cars, not the other way around

* ALL THE WAY  ‚ÄúIf you're going to try, go all the way. There is no other feeling like that. You will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire. You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. It's the only good fight there is.‚Äù ‚Äî Charles Bukowski, Factotum

* FAIL ORIGINALLY - "It is better to fail in originality than to succeed in imitation." ‚Äî Herman Melville

* PORTRAITS IMPROVE OVER TIME - older portraits gain in value, unlike a haircut

* Mackendrick's Bear -- Sandy mckendrick bear baiting story and the dawn of the information economy

* How to Take Dumb Notes

* AI's Threat to Identity - AI is more a threat to your identity than your income, if you have tied your identity too closely to a particular skill

* MANY MORE STILL IN THE CALENDAR
