Yet another post about toning black and white.

For the past couple of years I've blended the advice of two photographers to create a default Adobe Camera Raw (ACR) preset that I apply as a default to all raw files. This preset handles any needed B&W conversion and also add a mild color toning.

Using the same conversion for multiple mismatched cameras means that all the photos from events like weddings, protests, or grade-school picnics will be easy to mix -- even from scanned film negatives or a celphone.

Of course, there are problems. The main one is easy to fix.
