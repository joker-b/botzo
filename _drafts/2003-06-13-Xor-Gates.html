<p>If I handle a couple dozen <a href="/photo/strobeVolts.html">strobe voltage test reports</a> a day for the next week or so, I should eventually be caught up.</p>

<p>I've switched the digicam stuff to my XP-based machine, and then mount the directories from Mac OSX for Photoshop work. It's a much faster way to work than I had initially anticipated! I should move the scanner over there too. Then I can scan and do other useful work simultaneously. Best of both worlds?</p>
