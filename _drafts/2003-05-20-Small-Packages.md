![Cropped detail from Canon QL17 photo, Santa Clara 2003]({{ 'http://www.botzilla.com/bpix/may03j-05.jpg' | absolute_url }}){: .align-right}
So I scanned the first roll from the <a href="http://www.netaxs.com/~cassidy/images/equipment/ql17/ql17.html">Canon QL17.</a> <i>Ta da!</i> Not half bad. Side-by-side against the Contax, it lacks the last 5% of detail and doesn't match in terms of contrast &#151; but for a price slightly less than that of a single Contax lens hood, it's pretty solid.

The play in the lens is real enough, but seems constrained to a side-to-side movement, and has only marginal effect on focus (even wide-open). The case gets a good stiff dose of Febreze. Maybe it needs two doses.

The only real problem today &#151; where to get a 48mm lens cap on short notice? The Canon slip-on won't last, knowing how I treat gear. A check of <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com">B&amp;H</a> showed even Sky filters were scarce in 48mm &#151; most more-expensive than the camera, heh.

The focus lever turns in the opposite direction from Leica (and my other Canon RF). There are no DoF markings. Can't have everything.....
