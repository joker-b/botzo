<h3>The ground for the figure.</h3>

From the floor at Stanford University, Summer 2014.

Museums have rarely shaken-off their self-consciously church-like atmospheres. One must stand at a certain distance, view a particular way, under the prescribed conditions. These few photos were a poke, to the dismay of the security staff who are charged with giving Stanford's legacy the appropriately reverential  decorum, to look at the art works from a different vantage, and to celebrate the margins.
