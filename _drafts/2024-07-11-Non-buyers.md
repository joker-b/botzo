A big part of that rant boils down to photographers self-identifying themselves and their work with phrases like "I shoot Canon," or the slightly-broader "I shoot film." It's an assertion of a tribal affiliation, not of the work.

Part of the reason is surely the fact that "photography" magazines, and then websites  blogs, youtube and tiktok feeds, are _camera_ magazines, websites, blogs, tubes and feeds. They serve to The Muse or The Source, they are The Resistance. They encourage their readers and viewers to connect less to pictures and more to purchasable tools, or to measurable mechanical expertise.

Cameras, lenses, printers can be easily measured, quantified, ranked, priced. Are more megapixels better? It doesn't matter, they are _more._ Photographs? Artworks? Much more difficult, even if they're priced by the square inch.
