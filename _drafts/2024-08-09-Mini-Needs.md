The iPad Mini is more -- and less -- capable than you might expect as a tool for a traveling picture maker who doesn't want to carry a laptop.

This post expands a little on a previous post by fleshing-out the details of how I have used the Mini and iPadOS apps: when it has excelled, when it has struggled.

On balance, I've found it the best travel device, and have workarounds for the few challenges.

<!--more-->

Currently I'm using the current "2021" iPad Mini. Mine is the "big Mini," meaning it has 256GB of RAM. It's the wi-fi-only edition. I expect most notes in this post will still apply to the 2024 Mini, due around Halloween of this year.

As for accesories, I have an Apple Pencil and (sometimes) a bluetooth keyboard.

Importantly, I don't use the Mini as a _replacement_ for my PC. It's a terrific _travel data companion._

When I'm traveling, I'm traveling. The Mini is like a pocketknife -- it has the essential tools you really need when you're out far from your workshop. The screwdriver, corkscrew, and saws are usually good enough for simple tasks and importantly they are there at hand when you need them.

These tasks, for me, are:

* Data backup: I need to be able to regularly and reliably copy the contents of cameras and recorders onto an extra archive SSD, and then backup via cloud services to my NAS at home.
* Web access to manage the above, along with email or chat services.
* Very basic image editing, which will be _rarely used._
* Basic access to my remote computers

Tasks that are handy but only occasionally used, like that awl in your pocketknife:

* Drawing apps
* PDF readers/editors
* Youtube etc (I'm traveling, why waste time watching TV?)
* Page design and publishing tools

Sure, the Mini _can_ do these things and many more, but think of it like walking into a candy store: you can eat anything you like today, but you shouldn't try to eat _everything._ Set the FOMO aside, it's a distraction.

For photographers: think of traveling with the Mini like traveling with one camera and one prime lens. _Essentials._ You don't have to travel with the 18mm or the 400mm lenses, the strobes, the tripod, the backdrops or C-stands. Because of this, you also don't have a 40-pound or 80-pound backpack: just a little bag for batteries, pen and paper. It's a choice.

## Essential Accesories and Apps

* Inateck multi-port adapter (USB-C hub) with _extra USB-C port_
* Samsung T7 external SSD
* Optional: a bluetooth keyboard, Apple Pencil
* Just in case: a smartphone capable of being a mobile wifi hotspot

In rough order of "essentialness" here are the iPad apps I use when traveling:

* Apple _Files_
* iCloud
* GMail app (or your email service of choice)
* Chrome (or Safari -- some web browser)
* Chrome Remote Desktop
* iSH
* Affinity Photo 2
* Drawing apps: I have several, I use Concepts a lot for diagrams.
* LiquidText, Google Play Books, Kindle for long airline flights

The Inateck USB-C hub is the only one I've run across (they have a new and old version -- I like the old version because it travels well, no dangling cord. But both are great) that has both pass-through USB power and also an extra USB-C port -- most hubs have USB-A but not a C port. This port is charged, and the hub has am SD-card reader, so we can have a three-way connection whle still being connected to the wall power: iPad, SD card, and SSD drive.

At the end of each travel day, I plug all these together, than copy the day's photos from the SD card(s) onto the SSD. I personally use my own python program to do this, running within the "iSH" iPad app -- this is very slow but it handles some archiving management for me. Most people don't need that, and con just use the iPad _Files_ app to drag-and-drop quickly.

Once done, remove the SD card, make sure your iPad is connected to wi-fi, and now, on the iPad using _Files,_ copy all of your newly-saved SSD files into iCloud. This might take hours, which is why you can leave it until the end of the day.

Once everything's on iCloud, you now have two backups -- on the SSD and in iCloud.

As an extra optional step, I then use Chrome Remote Desktop to connect to a computer back in Sonoma County, where I fire-up the web access of my Synology NAS and copy all of the iCloud filez onto the Synology NAS. Now there are _four_ copies of my pictures -- the SD card, the SSD, iCloud, and the hard drives back in California.

Even without the extra step, things are looking good backup-wise. At that point, if I'm pinched for SD card space, I might feel pretty safe about clearing my card for the new day. Or just start using a new card.

If I want to edit, process, or send photos, I can use either the iCloud or SSD copies with Affinity Photo 2, which does a perfectly acceptable job for most purposes (Adobe has iPad apps too, I just haven't used them as often). Despite its size, the Mini has a  photo-edit feature absent on most laptops: _the pencil._ Seriously great.

### Workarounds

If you are addicted to your Nik filters when using Lightroom or Photoshop, consider a workflow that applies _Snapseed_ -- some of the development team and their algorithmic knowledge is shared by both.

If you don't have adequate iCloud capacity, try copying instead to Google Drive of DropBox -- I've tried all, and settled on iCloud because it was the most stable and could deal with wi-fi dropping-out, the iPad goinf to sleep, etc.

Don't skimp on your power adapter. Get a good one with a little headroom for running the SSD (and maybe even charging your phone and/opr camera batteries at the same time).
