The iPad Mini is more -- and less -- capable than you might expect as a tool for a traveling picture maker.

This post expands a little on a previous post by fleshing-out the details of how I have used the Mini and iPadOS apps: when it has excelled, when it has struggled.

On balance, I've found it the best travel device, and have workarounds for the few challenges.

Today I'm using the current "2021" iPad Mini. Mine is "big," meaning it has 256GB of RAM. It's the wi-fi-only edition. I expect most notes in this post will still apply to the next Mini, due possibly this year.

As for accesories, I have an Apple Pencil and (sometimes) a bluetooth keyboard.

Importantly, I don't use the Mini as a _replacement_ for my PC. It's a terrific _travel data companion._ When I'm traveling, I'm traveling. The Mini is like a pocketknife -- it has the essential tools you really need when you're out far from your workshop. The screwdriver, corkscrew, and saws are usually good enough for simple tasks and importantly they are there at hand when you need them.

These tasks, for me, are:

* Data backup: I need to be able to regularly and reliably copy the contents of cameras and recorders onto an extra archive SSD, and then backup via cloud services to my NAS at home.
* Web access to manage the above, along with email or chat services.
* Very basic image editing, which will be _rarely used._
* Basic access to my remote computers

Tasks that are only occasionally used, like that awl in your pocketknife:

* Drawing apps
* PDF readers/editors
* Youtube etc (I'm traveling, why waste time watching TV?)
* Page design and publishing tools

Sure, the Mini _can_ do these things and many more, but think of it like walking into a candy store: you can eat anything you like today, but you shouldn't try to eat _everything._ Set the FOMO aside, it's a distraction.

For photographers: think of traveling with the Mini like traveling with one camera and one prime lens. You don't have the 18mm or the 400mm lenses, the strobes, the tripod, the backdrops or C-stands. You also don't have a 40-pound or 80-pound backpack. It's a choice.

## Essential Accesories and Apps

* Inateck multi-port adapter with _extra USB-C port_
* Samsung T7 external SSD
* Optional: a bluetooth keyboard, Apple Pencil
* Just in case: a smartphone capable of being a mobile wifi hotspot

In rough order of "essentialness" here are the apps I use when traveling:

* Apple _Files_
* iCloud
* GMail app (or your email service of choice)
* Chrome (or Safari -- a web browser)
* Chrome Remote Desktop
* iSH
* Affinity Photo 2
* Drawing apps: I have several, I use Concepts a lot for diagrams.
* LiquidText, Google Play Books, Kindle for long airline flights
