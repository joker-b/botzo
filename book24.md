I love books and expect that if you're reading this page, you love books too. As an artist, I find books to be the best way yet invented to explore and share complex visual ideas: a whole gallery in your hand.

These new short-run editioned books and related art prints will first be available during [_Art at the Source 2024_]({{ site.url}}/aats) at [Sebastopol Center for the Arts](https://www.sebarts.org/) -- and especially during the open studio event, in Sebastopol at "Studio 16B" during the first two weekends of June.

* <span style="font-size:20px">**Studio Weekends in June:** 1-2 and 8-9 June<br/>[_Studio 16B, 583 Harrison Street, Sebastopol, CA 95472_](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fvQh5nn2MRaHsZsz8)</span>
* <span style="font-size:20px">**Opening Reception:** 11 May<br/>_Sebastopol Center for the Arts Main Gallery_</span><br/>
<b>Exhibitions remain in the SebArts Gallery through the 9<sup>th</sup>.</b>

During the event there will be some additional surprise titles and instagrammable situations at the studio created just for [Art at the Source 2024.]({{ site.url}}/aats)
