I love books and expect that if you're reading this page that you do too. As an artist, I find books to be the best way yet invented to explore and share complex and beautiful ideas.

The short-run books listed here will first be available during _Art at the Source 2024,_ which is both a gallery show at [Sebastopol Center for the Arts](https://www.sebarts.org/) and an open studio event, also in Sebastopol at "Studio 16B" during the first two weekends of June.

* **Opening Reception:** 11 May<br/>_Sebastopol Center for the Arts Main Gallery_
* **Studio Weekends:** 1-2nd & 8-9th of June<br/>_Studio 16B, 583 Harrison Street, Sebastopol, CA 95472_

Books will also be available for order or pre-order online.
