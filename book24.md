As an artist, I find books to still be the best way yet invented to explore and share complete visual ideas: a whole gallery in your hand.

These new short-run, editioned books *and prints* are currently available in-person during art events across Sonoma County like the just-completed [_Art at the Source 2024_]({{ site.url}}/aats), and selected titles will soon be available at book and gift stores.
