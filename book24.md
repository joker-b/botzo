<h2 style="text-align:center"><i>(and prints!)</i></h2>

I love books and I expect that if you're reading this page, you love books too. As an artist, I find books to be the best way yet invented to explore and share complex visual ideas: a whole gallery in your hand.

These new short-run, editioned *books and prints* will first be available in-person during [_Art at the Source 2024_]({{ site.url}}/aats) at [Sebastopol Center for the Arts.](https://www.sebarts.org/) The SebArts Gallery show is already open.  The open studio event is in Sebastopol at "Studio 16B" during the first two weekends of June, not far from the gallery and the town center.
