Books are still the best way ever invented to explore and share complete visual ideas: a whole gallery in your hand.

These new short-run, editioned books *and prints* are currently available in-person during art events across Sonoma County including [_Art Trails 2024_]({{ site.url}}/trails24/?title=books), and selected items are available at retailers such as Sebastopol's [Silk Moon Gallery.](https://silkmoonca.com/gallery/)
