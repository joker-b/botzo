_Dancing with No One_ is a product merging both years of synthetic image research and production reaching back for decades, and a history of fashion photography from my early professional years.

Available in two forms: as an individual short-run hardcover book, or as a softcover book packaged with one of several editioned prints from the _Dancing with No One_ project.
