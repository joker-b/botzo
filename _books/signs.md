_Forgotten Signs_ was begun in Hong Kong, during the season of the annual lunar new year, inspired by a pair of beloved pets owned by young relatives.

"What sign are the guinea pigs?" we asked.

"Guinea pigs don't have signs!" came back the kids' answer.

"Well why not? Why is there no sign of the guinea pig? Or for that matter, the cat, the duck, the crab?"

The result is a collection of alternative and forward-looking zodiac animals, illustrated in the style of traditional calendars, and each given a unique interpretive text.

They're new -- or were they forgotten, and only now remembered? There may be one that suits you perfectly.

Perhaps you've always felt that you're more than an ox, a rat, or even a dragon -- there may be a new and better sign for you. You might also enjoy choosing perfect new signs for your friends (or even enemies).

_Forgotten Signs_ is available as an individual hardcover book or in a softbound gallery edition, also packaged with editioned prints from the set.
