<p class="notice"><i>Forgotten Signs</i> is <a href="https://www.blurb.com/b/11960095-forgotten-signs" target="_blank">now available online!</a> 64 pages of illustrations and interpretation.<br /><br />You can also get a signed copy of the paper back or the original hardcover edition in person during Sonoma County art events or included with any purchase of a <i>Forgetten Signs</i> art print.</p>

_Forgotten Signs_ was begun by a pair of beloved Hong Kong guinea pigs, during the season of the annual lunar new year.

We wondered if their personalities were influenced by the calendar. And as animals without a calendar presence of their own, what might it be?

The result is a collection of new, alternative and forward-looking new zodiac animals -- new, or are they forgotten, and only now remembered?

Readers and visitors are invited to consider that perhaps they are more than an ox or rat -- there may be a new and better sign for them. Or enjoy choosing new signs for their friends (or enemies).

Available as an individual hardcover book or in a gallery edition, packaged with editioned prints from the set.
