_Forgotten Signs_ was begun by a pair of beloved Hong Kong guinea pigs, during the season of the annual lunar new year.

We wondered if their personalities were influenced by the calendar. And as animals without a calendar presence of their own, what might it be?

The result is a collection of new, alternative and forward-looking new zodiacal animals -- or are they forgotten, and only now remembered? Readers and visitors are invited to consider that perhaps they are more than an ox or rat -- there may be a new and better sign for them. Or enjoy choosing new signs for their friends (or enemies).

Available as an individual hardcover book or in a gallery edition, packaged with editioned prints from the set.
