As 2016 eneded in Havana: Fidel was dead. Now what? As 2017 began, it all seemed: _complicado._ Would everything normalize, would US investment storm into Cuba like a north wind, transforming it into Florida South? What might be swept away, what would be kept? Would Cuba escape its political and economic cage at last? What might the future of Cuba's young people become?
