In the Sebastopol Center for the Arts Gallery hangs a work made this year specifically for [Art at the Source 2024:]({{ site.url}}/aats) _The Two Algorithms of Life._

It is made on a sheet of machined aluminum with a texture not unlike that of your favorite digital companions, who watch over and guide you each day.

This original work, in an edition of _ONE,_ offers you the rare chance to make the right choice.
