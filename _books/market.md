_Made in the Financial District, San Francisco_

_Market Hours_ presents a larger slice of life in the Financial District, a "big brother" project to [_Sooner or Later Somebody's Going to Get Hurt._]({{ site.url}}/hurt) It collects more photographs and writings made daily over a year of continuous photographing on San Francisco's busiest streets.

In addition, _Market Hours_ is presented in a unique foldable form, to match the ever-changing flow of daily life among the thousands of bank, tech, and retail employees and customers encountered each day in the pre-pandemic FiDi.
