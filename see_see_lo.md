My artwork draws inspiration from the everyday beauty of life and wonders of nature. Color is my voice, a vibrant language I use to evoke emotions in my viewers. The greatest reward is when my art resonates with someone, creating a connection through shared experience.

As a creative, I like to explore all kinds of creating techniques and styles. For my studio work, I focus on oil & acrylic paintings, exploring a variety of surfaces to paint on, from traditional canvases to upcycled cigar boxes.

<!-- from See See:
Artist’s Statement 

Art. Is. Life. Is. Life

I believe that everything we do in life is art. The way we talk, what food we cook and the presentation, how we love… and of course how we release our creative energies. 

Through my work, I share things that I’m passionate about: nature, food, how to make the world a better place… I love to make art that makes people pause, contemplate, and have a little dialogue with.
