Artist’s Statement 

Art. Is. Life. Is. Life

I believe that everything we do in life is art. The way we talk, what food we cook and the presentation, how we love… and of course how we release our creative energies. 

Through my work, I share things that I’m passionate about: nature, food, how to make the world a better place… I love to make art that makes people pause, contemplate, and have a little dialogue with.

See See Lo is a Sonoma County artist.  Her artworks are percolations of small wonders in life, mixed with doses of imagination, humor and observation of the human condition. Viewers are reminded to savor special moments in everyday life.

Studying with teachers at the Art Students League in NYC, her works are mostly representational. Growing up in Hong Kong and in England, her multicultural background permeates through her paintings in oil, acrylic and watercolor. She paints on canvases, panels, papers and even cigar boxes.

Paintings from See See's studio are now available via Petaluma's <a href="https://www.riverfrontartgallery.com/">Riverfront Gallery.</a>

Explore, and share her joy of creation!
