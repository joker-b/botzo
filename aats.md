Thanks for visiting us for _Art at the Source 2024,_ both here on the web and also in person: the reception at [Sebastopol Center for the Arts on the 11th of May](https://www.sebarts.org/), and in Sebastopol "Studio 16B" during the first two weekends of June.

### Location: Studio 16B, 583 Harrison Street, Sebastopol, CA 95472

Event-specific editions of artworks will be available for purchase in-person, and also here via the web once the event begins.

The AatS venue is new for me, I am documenting the preparation in a series of posts:

* [5 March: _Sonoma Sources_]({% post_url 2024-03-05-Sources %})
* [22 March: _Sprung: Ten Weeks to Go_]({% post_url 2024-03-22-Sprung %})
* [9 April: _Sailing: Eight Weeks to Go, or Maybe Two_]({% post_url 2024-04-09-Sailing %})
