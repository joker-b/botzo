<h1>Thanks for Visiting during <i>Art at the Source 2024</i></h1>

[_Art at the Source 2024_](https://www.artatthesource.org/) has been Sonoma County's largest-ever multi-venue art exhibition and open-studios event. [**New Artworks and Books**]({{ site.url}}/book24) may still be available both from [Sebastopol Center for the Arts](https://www.sebarts.org/), retailers, or online.

For those who visited during the Open Studio Sessions at Studio 16b in Sebastopol: **Thank You** for your support, great conversations and ideas! Hope to see you at the next Sonoma County event (in Petaluma!) and always on the web.

### My AatS24 Experience

While I have long worked as a creator in many media, AatS's open-studio venue was new for me. The process was documented in a series of subjective posts:

* [25 April: _In the Wings: Five Weeks to Go, or Today?_]({% post_url 2024-04-25-Wings %})
* [11 May: _Orders and Deliveries: Three Weeks to Go in the Fuzzy Front End_]({% post_url 2024-05-11-Deliver %})

_Special Thanks to Jeweler [Barbara Harris, @BarbaraHarris_Designs](https://instagram.com/BarbaraHarris_Designs) for providing [studio gallery space!](https://www.artatthesource.org/barbara-harris) A bit like a photographer, Barbara seeks out rowdy and unusual materials to create unexpected one-of-a-kind pieces._
