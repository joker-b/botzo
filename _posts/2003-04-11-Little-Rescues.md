Score!

I hotsync my PDA on two different machines &#151; my work desktop at <a href="http://developer.nvidia.com" target="linkframe">NVIDIA</a> and my home game PC (separate from the work PC, and likewise separate from the Macs). Before syncing this morning I took a snapshot of the Handspring directory, and using cygwin "grep," picked through the contents looking for GoPix files. Once found, I stashed them off to a parallel directory (so as not to overwrite the archive dir), then told the Installer to install four files: Ses-ZTLS.PDB, Eqpt-ZTLS.PDB, Exp-ZTLS.PDB, Film-ZTLS.PDB and <i>voila</i> I've now got my GoPix data back to the state it was in when I last synchronized it, at 2:03PM yesterday afternoon.

<i>*great sigh of relief*</i>

Next comes the tedious but welcome part &#151; flushing all the existing logs out to text files, so they can ultimately be printed and those printouts added top the binders that hold sheets of negatives. Picking through GoPix I see that it's got about 50 rolls' worth of notes.
