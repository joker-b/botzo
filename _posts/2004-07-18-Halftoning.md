It's the 4th of July, time for fireworks and plenty of public parties, fairs, and parades. Just remember, don't <a href="http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_51989.asp" target="_blank">take photos at large public events,</a> and whatever you do don't go <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/30/nyregion/30deport.final.html?hp" target="_blank">videotaping in random public places,</a> lest you too might get three months of solitary confinement from agencies that know darned well you've done nothing wrong.

But don't worry, our <a href="http://www.madison.com/captimes/news/stories/74526.php" target="_blank">valiant public servants</a> are there to protect us from those bad, bad evildoers &#151; just hush up, slug back a Prozac or three and <a href="http://web.redding.com/specials/shooting/stories/photos.shtml" target="_blank">let them decide what you should see</a> so you don't go handing your children to Osama Bin Laden. After all,  they've been there to help us even <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/news/1996/0715m.html" target="_blank">well before</a> 9-11.

Now you may say, I'm just a big crab. Or a worthless commie Al-Quaeda-loving treasonous wrong-question-asking meanie. The US is still near the best part of the scale in the <a href="http://www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=20" target="_blank">RSF's Hall of Shame.</a> Still, it's more and more obvious that everyone's camera kit needs a <a href="http://www.krages.com/phoright.htm" target="_blank">bust card</a> just as surely as they need fresh batteries.
