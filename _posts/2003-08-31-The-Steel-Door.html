<p>We walk to the end of the rough stone passageway, stepping over the vents and
careful not to slip on the wet floor.  At the end of the
passageway is a steel door, a meter square, elevated from the
floor. The welding marks give a hint that the metal is heavy,
thick. Nearby a video camera on a pole watches the door, 24 hours a day,
well-lit, and the monitor at the other end of the video cable is monitored by a live person continuously.  Through a crack near the floor we can see
that the other side of the wall is also lit &#151; I'm assured that behind the
steel door are complex explosive traps, and more unblinkingly diligent video cameras. Two coils of barbed wire prevent me from walking the last six or
seven steps to touch the door. We're about 73 meters under the
ground, and 100 meters from North Korea.</p>

<p>The passageway was made by the DPRK's army, shoveling and
blasting for years, inch by inch, then kilometer by kilometer,
round the clock working their way steadily through the DMZ and
toward South Korea, in hopes of providing themselves a surprise
entry into the country &#151; that is until a South Korean team bored
a tiny hole into the passageway from above, then a larger tunnel
to intercept. The North Koreans fled after a short battle, and today
we have the door.</p>

<p>Six hours later I'm here at <a href="www.lottehotel.co.kr"
target=linkframe">Lotte World</a> in Seoul, relaxing in my room
and starting to type up this entry. It's hard to reconcile the
differences &#151; the rabid paranoia that drives the North Koreans
to dig deep secret invasion tunnels, applying not only brute
force but considerable cleverness and brainpower (such as
blasting TNT boreholes simultaneously in multiple locations in
North Korea, to prevent sonosensors from pinpointing the tunnel),
or to bomb airliners or ram minisubs into shipping lanes; in
comparison with the dense riotous consumer indulgence of the
South, which is only too apparent in the packed and busy malls
like Lotte World (or in the entertainments like the adjacent
Lotte World Adventure theme park).</p>

<p>Hard too to see how it continues even as the South continues to
hold onto the belief that this will all pass &#151; the train
stations with signs hopefully showing the direction to Pyongyang
station, the National Folk Museum filled with recent exhibits
that detail Korean history and regional cultural development,
both north and south as a single culture, without a whisper of
the name Kim Il Sung.</p>

<p>Visiting the burgeoning restaurants on Sincheon "food street," or
watching the revellers at nearby nightclubs like "New Hacker
Membership Discoteque," where the throngs grinding not only to Eminem
&amp; Ludakris but plenty of homebrew hiphop &amp; techno, it's
easy to see modernity and growth (yet with traditional
conservative Korean style: the girls dance with the gils while
the boys dance with the boys, and breaking that contract can
start a row). They say that the South's economy is now some 26
times the size of the North's (yet with only a 2-to-1 advantage
in population, and less land mass).  Looking through binoculars
across the border, past the giant border placards, statues, and
empty "propaganda village" and up in the hills to the real city
of Kaesung, you can see the unpaved roads, the distant walking
dots and the lack of motor vehicles.</p>

<p>Sadly photography is forbidden at the Steel Door &#151; though the
major-general in the car in front of us, hosting a Vietnamese
investor, has no problems toting-along an elisted man to carry an
impressive digital SLR.  But for we the un-selected, check the
camera with the MPs.</p>

<p>Even without that, I shoot ten rolls today. I load the eleventh
at just past midnight &#151; make it a quarter past September.</p>
