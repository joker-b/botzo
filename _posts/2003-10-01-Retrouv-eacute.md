![Santa Clara. 2003. 85mm, Tri-X, Rodinal. (C) 2003 K Bjorke]({{ 'https://www.botzilla.com/bpix/sep03zzH-08.jpg' | absolute_url }}){: .align-right}
<i>Three rolls of TMax 100 and another roll of Tri-X, Rodinal 1+25. TMax from around 6 minutes, the Tri-X for seven. Out of Rodinal, and out of fast film. Out of negative sleeve pages. Will have to sit tight until the next B&amp;H box appears.</i>

I observed <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2003-05-13-Crystallizing-Method %}">here</a> a while back that when I first started using my Canons, I used to use my 85mm almost exclusively. In recent years, I've switched to the wide end and use the 90mm Zeiss very little, stressing the 28mm and 45mm. I've been trying to understand/deconstruct what in my own tastes had changed.

Today I shot the latest in a few rolls I've been making completely using the 85mm. The experience was magical.

With the rangefinder, the 90mm feels like a real tele, and it's difficult to use at wide apertures or close (or both). The depth of field can be less than a centimeter, and without much preview.

With the SLR, the 85mm is made for close, tight work. It handles like the 45mm on the Contax. The comfort zone is a quarter-step back but the result still feels intimate without being pushy. Combined with the crispness of Tri-X in Rodinal, it's a thing of beauty.
