I made this little pair of charts comparing print and aspect ratios because I simply couldn't find one laid out this way: all centered to show the letterboxing for one axis or the other. The charts I could find invariably radiated out from the corner, which is less useful when preparing prints.

While these charts include only the frame shapes I typically use, it's easy to regenerate any variant you like -- other sizes such as 16:9 or A4 paper are already defined in the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xzita9SFu_1eHPtpc-mLuh_psomtsrYu?usp=sharing">Colab notebook here.</a> Just alter as you see fit, run it, and a new chart will appear in roughly a second or two.
