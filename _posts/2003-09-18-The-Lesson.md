When we were in Japan we switched hotels, from a western-styled business hotel to a Japanese-styled urban <i>ryokan.</i> After settling-in I thought to run out around the corner to the local Family Mart for a soda. For the first time in days I left my camera behind with Courtney &#150; I'd only be gone for five minutes, right?

No sooner do I turn that corner outdoors, than a lone guy comes running down the street toward me &#151; black suit, tie, and <i>a horse's head.</i> He's shouting and waving at people in an upper-story window across the street as he runs by. Me: no camera.

Today, I think to leave the Contax at home... I've got my little Canonet in the desk at work anyway, right? At lunchtime, I jot down to the cafeteria &#151; at the door there's a guy in a giant furry Shark suit (from the local hockey team). Me: no camera.

I feel an ominous trend developing.
