Already Spring? Ten weeks now remain until [_Art at the Source 2024_](https://www.artatthesource.org/). In the days since the last post, a number of tools have been added, books reviewed and designs thrown out, rooms and doors have been measured, data storage and analytics have been changed, ads were designed, print budgets budgeted, and many pictures I'd nearly forgotten have been recovered and are sure to make an appearance.

## Books

The work to be shown for sale at A.A.T.S. will always have a book-related context. The books -- at least the editions for the event -- ned to be printed. My expectation is that at least four weeks is required to reliably return anything yet to be printed from the printer, meaning thatbook redesigns ned to be completed by the irst of May -- only six weeks from now.

While some have been test-printed, some have... not, and sometimes the tests reveal that the design was flawed. This is a really pressing mental concern: if there's a four-week turnaround, it means that I really one have remaining time for _one_ test print before sending the final orders in. That test -- all three designs -- needs to be ready not in six weeks, but _two._

## Prints and Print Displays

The typical standard for events like AATS expect that visitors can browse through print racks. Those prints need to be 





I'm doing this work in concert with other Sonoma artists, most-notably [See See](https://seeseelo.com) but also my studio sponsor [Barbara Harris,](https://www.instagram.com/barbaraharris_designs/) who will be providing studio display space in Sebastopol -- there will also be a salon show at the [Sebastopol Center for the Arts](https://www.sebarts.org/), just a few blocks away from that dedicated display.

Here are some of the tasks required over the next three months that I'll be writing-up in more as-it-happens detail:

* Tax Registry with the County and State (already done)
* Placement and posting in the show catalog
* Creating a small number of images to fill-out some projects
* Creating New-for-the-show work
* Budgets and more-detailed budgets
* Designing and test-printing and production printing of several small series as books
* Creating and packaging editioned prints to go with those series projects
* Building-out my own toolkit for the art-fair format: physical and legal
* Promoting to specific audiences
* Tracking visitors to Botzilla from both the show catalog and the show
* Updating botzilla.com to enable a regular email newsletter, and also integration to a sales system

Early days! See you at Studio 16B on June 1st.
