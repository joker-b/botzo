<p>A couple of weeks back I made a short list of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/topic/62805/">B&W-related groups on flickr.</a> Click the link for the full list, I'll mention just a couple here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/newblackandwhite/">New Black and White</a> was created in reaction to some rather poor behavior from the admins of groups like "Black and White" &#151; the charter purpose is to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and present photography that's a bit more ambitious than the usual flickr free-for-all &#151; while still remaining open for public posting, images are often deleted based on purely subjective judgements.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/whiteandblack/">White and Black</a> is a similar group, with QA performed by keeping the membership list restricted to invitees.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/29184631@N00/">Black and White Portraits</a> is one of two B&W portrait groups. The quality of pictures here, imo, is a bit better.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/57796404@N00/">35mm Black and White</a> is the designated retro group, not far from</li>

<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/diybw/">Do It Yourself</a></li>

</ul>
