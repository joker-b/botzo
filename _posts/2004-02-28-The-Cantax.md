Today's (linkless) photo is for <a href="http://www.walkeast.com/">Eddie,</a> who tragically turned down a 300D because <a href="http://www.walkeast.com/diary.php?did=35">he didn't like the color</a> and it didn't look "Reuters" enough.

C'mon man, your Contax G2 is silver too (and the Leica as well? <i>Tsk!)</i> You know <i>darned well</i> that the camera body is just a little dark box at the back of the lens, with an extra little hole for peeping through.

It's also for <a href="http://www.37thframe.com/" rel="colleague">Michael Johnson,</a> who has rollover pains with regards to <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/columns/sm-04-02-01.shtml">cameras that aren't made of metal.</a> (You should subscribe to his newsletter anyway &#151; here's hoping he can manage to keep printing it!)

Now to doctor-up a logo...
