A season of transformation.

<a href="http://www.photoblogs.org/" target="linkframe">PhotoBlogs.ORG</a> seems to have taken a hint from nature and has similarly changed colors and flushed-away their database of sites. The addresses are still there, but the indexing has been stripped away, leaving only the bare branches. If you like botzilla, <a href="http://www.photoblogs.org/update-list/?domain=botzilla.com&action_id=2" target="pbframe">click here now</a> and tag it as a "favorite" to be shared on photoblogs.org's front page. Think of it as your good deed of the day.

The leaves drop to make way for new growth over the winter and spring. In a similar way, I'm going to be selling some of my 35mm Canon equipment. Like many shooters I've come to be buried in gear, with Canon FD, EOS, old screwmount rangefinders, Nikon AF, and Contax 35mm kit. I'm keeping the A-1 and a couple of lenses, along with the Contax and EOS, but will be placing a fair amount of FD gear on Ebay or Craigslist in the next few days. If you'd like first shot at any of this gear, email me now:
