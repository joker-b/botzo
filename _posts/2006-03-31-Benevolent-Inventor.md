<center>Time for the latest personality quiz!<br><script src="http://www.personaldna.com/t?k=fvoikFkVWqWWU&t=Benevolent+Inventor">

Does <a href="http://personaldna.com/report.php?k=fvoikFkVWqWWUaZ-GO-AAAAC-dfab">this</a> match my experience at <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/">GDC</a>?

I had a great time, though it was a tad wearying &#151; I worked in the <a href="http://developer.nvidia.com/">NVIDIA</a> booth, in the <a href="http://www.ps3land.com/">Playstation 3</a> portion of Sony's booth, spoke at a <a href="http://www.cmpevents.com/GD06/a.asp?option=C&V=11&SessID=2383">sponsored session on FXComposer 2.0 in game production pipelines,</a> and then on Friday gave a <a href="http://www.cmpevents.com/GD06/a.asp?option=C&V=11&SessID=1638">art track lecture on texture and shading interactions.</a> The last one surprised me &#151; I expected a last-day meager turnout, but instead the long double-sized conference room was filled to capacity with people sitting on the floor 15 minutes before the talk even began! I felt really excited and glad to be able to speak with all those game artists and programmers.

The slides representing my talks will be available in PPT/PDF form on the <a href="http://developer.nvidia.com/">NVIDIA Developer Website.</a>

(Hey, wait a minute... "<i>slightly</i> imaginative"? Aww, who pays attention to these lame-assed <a href="/blog/archives/000467.html">personality quizzes,</a> anyway?)
