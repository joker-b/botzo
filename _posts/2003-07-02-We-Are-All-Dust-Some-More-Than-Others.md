<i>Six rolls TMax 100, 9.5 mins Xtol 1+1 @ 20C.</i>

I've decided to start filtering <i>all</i> the water, not just for chemicals but for final washing as well. Today I replaced the whole lot of chemistry, and drip-dripped multiple gallons of water through coffee filters held in my fingers. Hopefully this high-tech approach will help eliminate some of the last, nagging dust problems.

Spent the past four days on vacation in a group of nine, in L.A., usually too busy to take wandering photos. Still, I came back with eleven rolls and a few dozen digital shots (sad to say, the digitals were as ever a disappointment... even though I was quite enthused as I was making them). Just a couple of those rolls in today's batches, but after a quick viewing I'm feeling positive about the negatives, still drying in the shower.

Disneyland and Universal Studios... if the TV has taken the place of the family shrine, then these sites are the religious pilgrimages of our day, the lands of the gods where we can pose with Mickey and SpiderMan, the untouchable and fictional made (at least momentarily) flesh.

Of course, when the real gods appeared at Disneyland for the premiere party of <i>Pirates of the Caribbean,</i> the faithful were shuttled to one side, allowed to cheer the gods' entrances at a distance, then expelled quickly from the park. It is not for mortals to see Darryl Hannah riding <i>Indiana Jones,</i> save through the channelling mediator of a TV camera.
