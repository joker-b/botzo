I'm working on <a href="https://kevinbjorke.com/japan2025/">a project</a> far from home. While there have been many weeks of preparation, research, emails, written reflections on the purpose, detailed itinerary and contact lists, from the first day of raging thunderstorms and lightning strikes things have been: different. Not the plan.

But also: <i>the plan.</i> The real plan. To let the local gods have their way, and to simply be their herald. The research and expectations provide ideas of what could be, while the mud on my boots from the seven waterfalls of Yude tells me truths unavailable from my desk. The research just helps open my eyes a little to see past my over-organized location and shot lists.

As Eisenhower's often quoted: "plans are worthless. But planning is essential." The chaos <i>is</i> the organization.
