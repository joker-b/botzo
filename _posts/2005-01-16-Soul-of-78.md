Thanks mom!

Over the past few days a number of boxes have arrived in the mail, the result of my mother cleaning her basement. In them, various treasures, like an original unopened <i>Batman: The Dark Knight</i> poster, a manual on BASIC for the IBM 360, and hundreds of photographs that I'd left behind when attending <a href="http://www.calarts.edu/">CalArts.</a> I've only opened the first box, and hardly begun to even sort them, much less print or scan.
