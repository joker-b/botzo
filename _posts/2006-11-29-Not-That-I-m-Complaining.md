So I come all the way to Iceland, swing by Sirkus in search of elves Sigur Ros & Bj&ouml;rk only to discover: who's playing Reykjavik tonight? San Francisco band <a href="http://mbl.is/mm/folk/frett.html?nid=1237069">Brian Jonestown Massacre</a>, and just around the corner from my hotel. So Remo & I hike back down the hill to Club Nasa to pick up the beginning of their set. Playing warmup were local bands Singapore Sling and Jakobinarina &#151; we meet Sikka from Sirkus & then Bibi from Jakobarina &#151; she assures us <i>they</i> were even better. Maybe next time....

Not bad for a Wednesday night in the dark and relatively touristless "quiet" season.
