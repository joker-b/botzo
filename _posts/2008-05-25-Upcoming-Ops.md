A few busy weeks coming up!

On the heels of <a href="http://www.contactphoto.com/">Contact</a>, I'm heading to Madrid in a few weeks to visit See See and to scout around the shows of <a href="http://www.phedigital.com/festival/">PHotoEspa&ntilde;a</a> (suggestion of "must see" shows greatly appreciated), followed by a zip up to the much-overphotographed <a href="http://www.guggenheim-bilbao.es/?idioma=en">Guggenheim</a> in Bilbao and whats sure to be entirely too much fantastic food.

Isaac's birthday and graduation from Middle School are also approaching, even earlier -- and then as soon as I'm back from Spain, he's in for three weeks of rock n' roll camp while we also deal with <a href="http://www.siggraph.org/s2008/">Siggraph</a>, <a href="http://www.caextreme.org/">California Extreme</a>, <a href="http://www.airventure.org/">Oshkosh</a> (maybe), <a href="http://www.xnagamefest.com/">Gamefest</a>, and yeah, the girl on the far right of the photo above is carrying an <a href="http://www.nvision2008.com/">NVISION</a> bag, where I'll be <a href="http://speakers.nvision2008.com/agenda/index.cfm">speaking</a> about the future of real-time character animation and rendering (with special guests -- some incredible NVIDIA partners).
