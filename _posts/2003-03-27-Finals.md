<p>After a year of sitting on it, Warners has finally released <a href="http://www.whatisthematrix.com" target="linkframe"><i>Final Flight of the Osiris,</i></a> the final production of the <i>Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within</i> studio, <a href="http://www.squaresoft.com/" target="linkframe">Square</a> USA. Though it gets this release in theatres, latched-onto <a href="http://dreamcatchermovie.warnerbros.com/" target="linkframe"><i>Dreamcatcher</i></a> as a standalone short, it will also appear as part of the upcoming <i>AniMatrix</i> DVD.</p>

<p>What a difference a year makes! After <i>Final Flight</i> I shifted my attention from <a href="http://www.arstechnica.com/wankerdesk/01q3/ff-interview/ff-interview-1.html" target="linkframe">production on a massive scale</a> to <a href="/photo/DawnMaya.html">doing it all on your PC</a> (and every scale in between).  I've been hammering furiously at the latest release of the <a href="http://developer.nvidia.com/view.asp?PAGE=cg_main" target="linkframe">CgFX plugins</a> for <a href="http://www.aliaswavefront.com/" target="linkframe">Maya</a> and <a href="http://www.discreet.com/" target="linkframe">3ds Max.</a> I hate to sound like an ad but for <i>me,</i> this stuff is hecka great &#151; lets you work-out ideas about light, shading, and texture really quickly and fluidly. I'm really keen to get one of the upcoming GeForce FX Go laptops &#151; studio!</p>

<p>(Now if I can just find a way to wedge 150 artists into that same suitcase....)</p>
