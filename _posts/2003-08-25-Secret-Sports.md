I planning our upcoming trip to Tokyo, I'm surprised at how little info there is on the web (other than in Japanese) about <a href="http://www.kyotei.or.jp/" target="linkframe"><i>kyotei</i></a> boat racing. We passed a stadium along the highway during the past visit, while driving down toward Haneda airport &#151; huge place, yet not found in any web tour guide that I've come across. Hmmm.....

If anyone has some pointers on seeing the races, please let me know!
