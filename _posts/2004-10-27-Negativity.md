<i>Four rolls of Tri-X, two rolls of Pan-F</i>

The Canon is returned and good as new but not before I got a bit comfy wearing my older hat, pushing Tri-X and even Pan-F through the Contaxes. I was worried something was wrong with them, but discovered it was one of my strobes &#151; an otherwise nice little Metz no longer fires. Back to my ancient Sunpak 322.

Somewhat as I suspected, the film cameras are still funner to use, and the big viewfinder of the RTS makes the little DSLR finder seem toylike. I seem to have gotten my development process down smoothly enough that there's essentially no spotting required, but it's still a chore to soup and scan and print. Ah well.

After a while spent with smooth digital pics the grain of Rodinal-processed Tri-X is a big switch. For the first time I'm starting to think consciously about how there's a sort of motion in grain, that it can scatter like light moving in the air, lending immediacy and depth to an image.
