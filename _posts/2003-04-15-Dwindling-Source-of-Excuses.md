So <a href="http://www.geekychick.net/">Courtney</a> brought my last two C-41 rolls from the To-Do box to Long's this afternoon and now I have a shot-but-unprocessed backlog of <i>zero,</i> not counting the couple of rolls that are currently loaded in cameras (including an Ektachrome 100VS 6x6 roll from <i>January,</i> *sigh*). If I want more pictures, I'd best go out and make some.

Current supplies: five rolls of TMax 100, 13 rolls of Delta 400, two rolls of Kodak Gold 100 neg and a test roll of the new Ektachrome 100 G. About a half-dozen 120 E100VS rolls, two long-cut (old bottom-loading Leica-style) TMax 100 rolls, and of course the digital... with about 200 exposures of ancient digibacklog from Helsinki needing to be spooled-off to CD (never to be seen again?).

The real question, as ever, is what to do with it.

Ideas jotted into the visor at various times:

<ul>
<li>Rooms of the House</li>
<li>Seeing beyond the seen: psychics</li>
<li>The ongoing "infinity marker project" (inside joke w/Contax)</li>
<li>Crappy bars</li>
<li>Gameboy</li>
<li>I-880</li>
</ul>

Grrr. None of them seem all that satisfying, at least not at this hour. Psychics, though &#151; seeing beyond or through or past the surface of things is what they're all about, at least that's the story. And maybe that's exactly what I want to get out of these pictures &#151; a source of second sight. Or do I really want to degenerate the unseen into objects, handy little paper rectangles? Am I just looking for an excuse to objectify every experience? I'm pretty darned sure I don't want scenic vistas and adorable kitties, but I'm feeling waffly about what I <i>do</i> want today.  Ticks me off at myself.
