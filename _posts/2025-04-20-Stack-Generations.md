A few weeks ago I realized that the entire print run for my small book _[Graffiti Generations]({{ site.url }}/generations)_ had _sold out_ -- I only had my own copy remaining!

The stack had evaporated over about six months, a process which had snuck up on me by ones and twos.

Just in time for Sonoma County's _[Art at the Source 2025]({{ site.url}}/aats25)_ event, a small run of _Graffiti Generations_ has been reprinted. The same format and same 47 photographs, several of which you may have seen exhibited at galleries around the Bay Area.

Copies of _Graffiti Generations_ purchased in-person are signed and studio-stamped. After the summer art fair copies will also be available online, though without those handmade marks.
