<p>Here's a posting for all computer graphics folks.</p>

<p>Siggraph sketches are a great, lightweight way to publicize/recognize new developments and ideas in graphics (plus you get a Conference Select uber pass!). Some folks mistakenly think of sketches as "papers lite" but they're much more. They cover all aspects of the Siggraph sphere, including workstation, education, entertainment, mobile, fine art, supercomputing... Last year's sketches ranged from image-based modeling; to innovative display paradigms; to real-time illumination; to letting police see around corners; to production of films like "Star Wars" and "Madagascar"; to spontaneously beaming romantic music from your phone to the cute stranger at the other end of Starbuck's.</p>

<p>Deadlines are in just a couple of weeks, but preparation is not difficult. Here's the "CFP":</p>

<p><h4>Call For Participation</h4></p>

<p>The Sketches program is one of the most dynamic programs of the annual 
SIGGRAPH conference, which will be held this year 30 July - 3 August 
2006 in Boston, Massachusetts USA. Sketches provide an opportunity for 
researchers, artists, and practitioner to share new results, show live 
demonstrations of their work, and participate in a unique forum for new 
and thought-provoking ideas, techniques, and applications in computer 
graphics and interactive techniques.</p>

<p>Accepted sketches will be archived in the ACM Digital Library as well as 
on the SIGGRAPH Conference DVD and Conference Abstracts and Applications 
CD-Rom. During the conference, the authors will be given 20 minutes to 
present their work. We are seeking submissions that provide a single 
page PDF summary of provocative speculations, nascent academic research, 
industrial development, practical tools, and behind-the-scenes 
explanations of commercial and artistic works. Submissions covering any 
topic which would excite the interest of a computer graphics audience 
are welcome.</p>

<p>Sketch summary PDF submissions must be written and presented in English. 
Paper length should not exceed one single-sided page in letter format, 
should include the collaborators names together with their affiliations 
and must be formatted according to the SIGGRAPH publication style. In 
addition, you MUST provide a .jpeg image which acts as a visual 
remainder of the sketch. The image can be any size, however, the 
submission system will resize it to a 150x150 pixels image. 
Supplementary material such as videos, images and/or further 
documentation may also be submitted electronically and will be made 
available to reviewers. Please, refer to the submission website for
more details and keep in mind that the total size of all uploaded files
must not exceed 40 MB.<br>
