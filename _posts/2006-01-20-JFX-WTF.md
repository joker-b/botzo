You read it here first....

Well not really since I have been sending SMS pages with the expression "JFX" for some time. I thought it was a common parlance but I haven't been able to find it in any web search, so maybe I just made it up. I like it regardless.

"JFX" is short for "Jesus FX" which appealed to my picture-making nature.

"Jesus FX" is in turn is short for the maledictive "Jesus F***ing Christ"

Except that, unlike this blog post, it can appear in a Google safe-mode search.
