After a lot of struggling with color profiles I'm back to printing B&W prints via pure-black on Epson Matte. Shadow detail is better on small prints with multiple color, but for a larger print the pure-black is fine, the blacks are truly black, and the hazards of metamerism are left far behind. For my printer, at least, it seems to be better to print @ 720dpi "finest detail," rather than 1440dpi.

Made about 30 prints yesterday, most for the current project, the printer humming in the background while I prepped materials for the class I'm giving at <a href="http://www.siggraph.org/s2003/" target="linkframe">Siggraph 2003.</a> The prints are all around the living room, there for me to ponder for a while. I plan on printing some of them quite large, maybe 50" square.
