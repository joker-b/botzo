Answering some questions about my experience in the _[Art at the Source 2024]({{ site.url}}/aats)_ exhibition and open studio events.

## Would I Do It Again?

Yes, I'm already signed-up and now preparing for _[Art Trails 2024]({{ site.url}}/trails)_ in October. This was my plan all along, really: do both a spring and autumn event, the first one as a complete naif and the next one as a nearly-complete naif.

During _Art at the Source,_ I learned... many things. About people, about my art, about expectations and gratitude.

The exhibition space for _Art Trails_ will be different: in Petaluma, not Sebastopol, larger, more controllable, and not in a shared space. Some learnings from _Art at the Source_ will apply, some won't. Some were expected, some were surprises:

## Expectations and Surprises

I had many expectations. Some turned out correct, others... 

### Expected: Photographers Don't Buy Photography

_(and more generally: artists don't buy art)_

They just don't.

When a photographer visitor arrives in your studio, you can expect great conversations, yes. Megapixels or meta-analysis, and all good. I love hearing, in person, about other photographers: their methods, experience, philosophies, frustrations, goals.

But purchasing.... Film, lenses, flashes, plugins, printers, adapters, hard drives: sure. Photographs: nope.

I wrote a long opinionated rant about why this is, and then deleted it. I knew about this pattern in advance, and people who know, know. I'll save the rant. Just trust me when I say this: _photographers don't buy photography._ I'm pretty sure the same can be said for painters not buying paintings or sculptors not buying sculpture (to a degree, this is less true for jewelers? Barbara's ongoing fans were sometimes also makers. A credit to her!).

With that expectation in mind, when I distributed my promo cards, I knew that people who had an interest in the _content_ of the work were more likely as an audience. That Giants fans might like to buy a book about Giants fans. That book collectors might like unusual books. Members of the Norcal Carshow scene might like to see photos that admire and celebrate themselves, their friends, the culture. Whatever the work, unless you're Ansel Adams the market won't be photographers.

Most of my promo efforts went to places where I hoped the might the attention of  people whose first words after their arrival weren't likely to be: "what was the shutter speed on this one?"

There was only a small, but measurable, benefit to this effort. The QR code on the promo cards is slightly different from the ones in the catalog, so I'm able to know how some number of viewers came to my dedicated AatS page. There definitely were people who came from book fairs, car shows, local event calendars. I can hope that occasionally some of these friends will see the pictures and tell more friends.

This might all sound like I had a _plan,_ and... I did? But:

### Nobody Really Knows Anything

My belief, going into the event, was that the books --  _[Forgotten Signs,]({{ site.url}}/signs)_  _[Graffiti Generations,]({{ site.url}}/generations)_ and work from the _Liquidity SF_ series:_[CHAMPIONS]({{ site.url}}/champions)_ and _[Sooner or Later Someone's Going to Get Hurt]({{ site.url}}/hurt)_ -- would elicit the most interest and be the strongest sellers.

This was wrong.

People came into the Studio for many reasons:

1. They saw the index image (from _Liquidty SF_) in the catalog.
2. They saw the ad (which had _Forgotten Signs,_ _Grafitti Generations,_ and _Liquidity_) in the catalog.
3. They habitually visit that same Studio location every year (it's my first year, but not Barbara's)
3. They saw a generic "Art at the Source" placard as they were driving by on Highway 116, which is a trunk road.
4. They saw a generic "Art at the Source" placard as they were on a walk along the very nearby Joe Rodota Trail.
5. They got a promo card, either in the post, or from a store, coffee shop, etc.
6. They were neighbors.
7. They were friends of mine.
8. They were friends of Barbara's.
9. They only came to see Barbara's studio, and actually had no interest in me or my work.
9. They saw _["The Two Algorithms of Life"]({{ site.url}}/two)_ at the SebArts Gallery and felt they needed to see what was going on over at Studio 16b.
9. They'd received or seen a promo copy of _Graffiti Generations_ during the American Grafitti Days event or the Cruise for Peggy Sue.
10. They checkmarked all the "photographer" entries in the catalog and visited them.
10. They checkmarked all the "jewelery" entries, visited them and my pictures just happened to be there.
11. They checkmarked all the catalog map numbers in a certain area and visited them.
12. They are a plus-one trailing along behind someone who has any of the above reasons.

None of these possibilities align with whether or not someone will buy art, or even notice it, much less engage with the it enough to browse through the stacks or open a sample book.

_But some people did._

Which is what makes the effort worthwhile.

<p style="font-size: 22px;"><i><b>Thank You.</b></i></p>

Thank you to the people who deliberately sought out my pictures. Thanks to the people who didn't but found them and had to look. Thank you to the friends who sometimes made some pretty long drives to Sebastopol. Thank you to the people who hadn't expected to see pictures at all, and who ended up going home with them: on a print, in a book, or in their memory.

#### Surprises: _No One_ was First

The work that attracted the most sales attention, by far, was _[Dancing with No One.]({{ site.url}}/dancing)_  Several prints sold, all of them at the larger size, and of the two editions of the book I had on hand -- softcover or larger hardcover -- nearly all of the hardcovers sold. 

I'd made smaller prints, and smaller books, to smooth the on-ramp. In truth, people who really loved these pictures, the poetry of this project, didn't want a low on-ramp. They wanted whatever their budget would bear.

_Dancing with No One_ inspired conversations among visitors, paging through the books or racks, showing one another the prints, talking about the color or the flow. One visitor, browsing the book picture by picture, reached the end, give an audible inhale and then held it up for me to look, as if I'd never seen it before. She had to share? I was and still am very moved to have seen her reaction.

Humbling in many ways.

#### Less than Expected, _Forgotten_

Similarly, the larger hardcover edition of _[Forgotten Signs]({{ site.url}}/signs)_ was prefered over the smaller softcover. Those two projects were the ones with two editions, and basically, the nearly all the softcovers that moved out of the studio were ones bundled with an associateed print.

Every [book title]({{ site.url}}/book24) sold at least _one_ copy. I am thankful for that. But some titles: more.

#### Bookless Wonders

While _Dancing with No One_ sparked one set of conversations, the artworks that caused the loudest voices were portraits from a project that hasn't yet been "booked." They're  of fictional characters, part of a long-running and growing series that includes _RBF._ The single print that got the most "conversational traction" shows an ambiguous-aged tattoed female character. Some people hated it, loudly, immediately. Others adored it, reacting with equal voice.

People asked me the story about this picture. Amazingly, people _told_ me stories about this picture.

What pleased me was that regardless of the valence, reactions were strong. People couldn't always "figure it out" to their satisfaction, but had strong feelings.

Yet: no one bought the print. They looked, they opined, sighed, laughed and discussed with their friends. Maybe I should have had it on the wall, framed. Maybe I should have mentioned to people engaged with it that if this picture caused so many conversations in this little studio, imagine what it could do in your restaurant, in your sitting room, your salon.

I did not do these things. Probably I should have done. Maybe not. But it was gratifying to be close to the reactions, immediate and in person. Credit cards not required.

#### More

As for _[RBF,]({{ site.url}}/rbf)_ once I bundled the cards in sets of six they did sell better (and six at a time). I also received a request to provide some to a retailer, which is terrific! Expect to see details about that soon.

After the weekends, I realized that many studio artists had been social-posting photos, often as selfies, of the people who were buying their art. It never occured to me! Even though phones figure prominently in many of my pictures.

I was asked repeatedly if I teach classes, and also if I accepted commercial work. Should I have pursued these offers?

My promo cards included a picture from a series I never even showed (!) called _Paperwork._ I ought to show it.

I heard from Barbara that an unnamed man, age and origins unknown, who was for some reason really steamed about one of the pictures I had up, a little guy holding a plastic assault rifle. I have no idea why this person was riled, since they never spoke to _me,_ even when I was right there. Do they hate gun? Love guns? Did they not like the wallpaper? I may never know. But: strong reaction, I guess!

Barbara predicted I'd have the best sales on the last day. She was right! Including at least one person who came back from the previous weekend.

## Many Kinds of Tasks

Tasks that still remain that were never completed for _Art at the Source._ Next time?

Will I produce promotional video clips for _Art Trails?_ I'd like to.

I still have not yet set up online artwork ordering. This will get done soon -- if you're now reading this after discovering about it via a post-June newsletter, it's already available.

#### The End: Storage

After the Open Studio effort, I still had everything scattered and stacked everywhere. Prints, mattes, temporary workbenches... it took two full Subarus to move it all, and one long day of rapidfire cleaning (just before the arrival of houseguests) to get my regular workspace back to "normal." Maybe even a little more organized than normal.

## The Gallery Show

Even though the studio was not far from the main gallery, I discovered that studio visitors had often not visited it. Many didn't even know about it -- they were following the catalog or the signs and were unaware of the show at SebArts.

As mentioned in another post, these events are arranged such that outside of the reception, exhibiting artists don't really see the studios of the other artists, at least not on Open Studio days. A puzzle! But at least you can get something in front of people for a couple of hours on one afternoon. Looking forward to the next one.

### Satellite Galleries

Petaluma's _[Gallery One](https://petaluma-galleryone.com/)_ kindly hosted a side exhibit for local artists. As I'd mentioned earlier, I offered a pretty conservative piece for this. Once I saw it on the wall, however, I realized: I don't want to do conservative pieces. Next time:

<p style="font-size: 22px;">Safety last! All monkey, no pedestal!</p>

# Onward

Again, I find myself three months away from a [Studio Opening.]({{ site.url}}/trails) Two and a half months from the opening reception, and with a work and travel schedule that will shave many of those weeks away.

Exhibiting here in my Petaluma space is likely the most serious hazard. It's a larger space, sure. I can show more works, even have my portrait kit up and ready to go. Maybe a drawing robot, robotically drawing.

The hazard is the less-touristy location.

In central Sebastopol, there were a dozen other studios within walking distance. Here, people must drive. There are no other studios nearby, and worse, there isn't a busy downtown four blocks away with restaurants to feed visiting weekenders.

Many of the people who discovered my artwork during _Art at the Source_ in Sebastopol were the +1's or other companions who started browsing while waiting for their friends and partners who were visiting Barbara's jewelry offerings.

In Petaluma, with no other artist in the location, no other nearby studios, no tourism infrastructure, it will be a different challenge: the challenge to get even one person to appear at the door, because they came to see something that they think will be worth seeing.

I have many new and unseen artworks to share, that's not really a question. And I have plans for a completely new piece for the gallery reception already. If I had to open  by this weekend... hmm, it's Tuesday? Yeah, I could be open for business, though I'd prefer some time to lay the groundwork.

See you in October!

## Books and the "Dancing Oops"

In setting up for a reprint of _[Dancing with No One]({{ site.url}}/dancing)_ I found a fault in the book layout. And fixed it. And added a bookstore-friendly external ISBN code.

If someone who has an original reads this and would prefer a copy without the error, contact me.

#### Book Costs

The books and zine-like books I've offered during _Art at the Source_ have had very small print runs. This is fine for their original intent: to provide a structure for understanding and enjoying my prints.

Small runs are very pricey per-book. Even at $60, the hardcover _Dancing with No One_ had to sell with a narrow margin. Typically, the routes to solving this are either double-down on exotic quality and raise prices for a low-run item, or find a different distribution channel so that prices can be lower at the risk of a large intial print run. Problems, problems.

I love problems.

> Our family are growers, inventors, explorers.
> Dad was raised on a horse-powered farm, yet by 35 his navigation designs landed people safely on the moon. Some of his excited curiosity and Mom’s typewriter came with me to art school. Since then I’ve explored new ways to make images, built tools for artists and teams to create new meanings and experiences, and of course to share with the world. Along the way I’ve collected awards and patents for films, cameras, games, theme park rides, books – all of them driven by the questions “What if?” and “then what?” and a drive to discover: “what would it feel like?”
> Alongside the collaborations with clients and corporations, my personal explorations have always continued. By camera, computer, or both: always curious.
> If you love seeing what’s over the next hill, please come by the studio in Sebastopol. It’s on Harrison St, up behind Rotten Robbie’s, a garden near the hiking trail. The prints and related books I’m sharing for Art at the Source this year reflect some of my ongoing delight in what can be coaxed from glass, metal, and an occasional spark.
