Friday the 13th. Usually for such occasions we go to a party at the Black Cat Bar, a Nob Hill remnant of the old San Francisco Press Club. For 2021, no party.

Two nights earlier, there was live jazz at the upper bar and as always a spectacular end-of-day foggy view from the dining room. But no other diners to share it.
