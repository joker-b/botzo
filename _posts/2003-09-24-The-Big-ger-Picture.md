<img src="http://www.botzilla.com/bpix/sep03za-08.jpg" width=400 height=271 border=0 align="right" hspace=8 vspace=6 title="(C)2003 Kevin Bjorke"></a>After some late-night <a href="http://moveabletype.org" target="linkframe">MT</a> tweaking, I'm moving to larger photos on the front journal pages &#151; though as before, <i>all journal photos are probably clickable.</i>

At this point in its history, <a href="/">Botzilla</a> has become something of an <a href="http://www.growbag.net/book3/index.asp" target="linkframe">archeological museum</a> of trends in web design and software, wiith layers of material from different eras and projects. There are still snips here and there from the original National Pixel Products site, back when I had NatPix hosted on <a href="http://www.rahul.net/" target="linkframe">rahul.net</a> (one of the earliest companies to offer hosting for individuals) &#151; amazingly it was even listed on the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/concord/message/13138" target="linkframe">NCSA's Cool Site of the Day,</a> back in those dark, pre-Yahoo days. Then came <a href="/photo/">photo</a> stuff, then the <a href="/house/">House o' Props n Bots</a> for my old housemate <a href="http://www.jbum.com/" target="linkframe">Jim's</a> little project, aka <a href="http://www.jbum.com/jbum/#105916766825173370" target="linkframe">The Palace;</a> then new layers of <a href="/photo/2001/">photos galleries</a> and <a href="/photo/G1links.html">digicam info</a> and <a href="/photo/psGallery.html">more galleries</a> and the <a href="/journal/">journal</a> and <a href="/photo/journal/">another gallery</a> associated with <i>that.</i>

I've considered gutting the whole thing &#151; considered adding a cool <a href="http://www.kartoo.com/" target="linkframe">kartoo</a>-like site map &#151; but for now I think I like it as-is, a rambling <a href="http://www.winchestermysteryhouse.com/" target="linkframe">Mystery House</a> of a site. Just listen to those hammers.

<hr width="30%" align="center">As a side note, for an extra site wing I'd love to build some day (if I thought I could withstand the liability risk): CNN reports today on the latest way that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/09/24/walmart.photo.suit.ap/index.html" target="linkframe">corporations and cops are preserving photographers' right to be senselessly harassed.</a>
