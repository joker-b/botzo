<i><a href="https://artatthesource.org">Art at the Source 2025</a></i> begins in two days: I've been printing recent images, including this one from the set "桜風" or "Cherry Blossom Wind," photographed during 2025's <i>sakura</i>-viewing season.

My studio space will be open June 7-8 and 14-15 in Petaluma: <a href="https://www.artatthesource.org/kevin-bjorke">Studio 4:</a> 65 Eastside Circle, <b>Petaluma</b> (_not_ Sebastopol).

During the studio days I'll also be showing some prints of early machine-learning work, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/-QImBRy7kv/">dating back to 2015.</a> Today this would be called "AI" – I called it "neurography" at the time. Hard for me to believe some of it's a decade old now!.

In the middle of my library-turned-art-space, I'll be operating a drawing robot (err, "Art Machine System"), an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJpoiJN2tUM">ArtFrame 2436.</a> In the interest of sanity I'll just be making drawings with it – my ultimate goal for it is oil pastels but that's far too messy, error-prone, and highly demanding of my every-second attention.

There are two annual open-studio seasons each year: my take on them is that <i>Art at the Source,</i> in the Spring, is more educational-focused; while <i>Art Trails</i> in Autumn is a little more gallery-like. With considerable overlap! But in that spirit, for <i>Art at the Source</i> I'm emphasizing visible process.

"Process" for my sort of art-making is an awkward fit to the open-studio format: I won't include the chair I sit in each morning, writing notes in pen; nor should they watching me coding (I assure you: very boring); nor can I take visitors directly on a journey to the Kiso Mountains (where the 桜風 photos were made) or for that matter even <a href="https://botzilla.com/generations/">downtown.</a> At the same time, for this event I can feel relaxed and okay to be more direct about what works and doesn't.

For a potter or painter, the relationship between act and object are more obvious: for someone who uses locations, light, and often electronics, less so. This makes me glad that to have two different events for similar yet divergent purposes.
