Two strong recommendations today for excellent but almost unknown photoblogs:

The first is a new blog attached to the established site of <a href="http://www.clayenos.com/">Clay Enos,</a> who had previously been half of the <a href="http://www.streetstudio.com/">StreetStudio</a> team (the other half being fellow New York photographer Stephan Ghukfvin). Clay's blog, begun late last year: <a href="http://clayenos.blogspot.com/"><i>Take Pictures.</i></a>

<!--more-->
The second blog to recommend was discovered sideways via Clay's use of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">flickr</a>: Dennis Dunleavy's <a href="http://ddunleavy.typepad.com/the_big_picture/"><i>The Big Picture?</i></a> Dunleavy is just around the corner in San Jose, no less. Now I know who's been checking out all the books I can't find in the King Library.

In celebration of these discoveries I'll be trying to take some pictures down a the Coachella Music Festival over the next few days. They don't permit cameras with interchangeable lenses so I'll be slogging-along the TLR and a couple of Tri-X Pro-Packs.
