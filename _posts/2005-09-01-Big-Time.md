...the first tangible product of my New Toy, a <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/columns/sm-03-02-16.shtml" target="_blank">Bronica RF645 6&#215;4.5 rangefinder,</a> a terrific vertical-format "Texas Leica."

The reception will be tomorrow evening, and the photos in the show will be on display throughout September.

More entries, including a roundup of Siggraph and a range of organization changes, in the coming days.
