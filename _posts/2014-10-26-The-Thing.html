<p class="well"><i>"In photography, you always have both the medium and the depicted subject at the same time."</i> -- Thomas Ruff</p>

<p>In Ruff's work, the image is a very particular thing. I especially like his over-enlarged internet Jpegs. His more recent work has wandered into CG and crypto-photograms, a process that creates an image of imagery, where the "true" object, placed on photo paper, is itself replaced by an ephemeral concept, a mental image of an optical image. So meta.<p>

<p>The crisis of "thingness" in photography is at once at the root of many of its greatest strengths and weaknesses, as pointed out by painter Gerhard Richter:</P>

<p class="well">Photography has almost no reality; it is almost a hundred percent picture. And painting always has reality...</p>

<p>...by which he appears to mean that a painting is an object to itself while a photo is an image separate from any specific object -- a mechanical recording of the <i>real</i> image, the collections of things and light that passed for some time in front of the lens. A painting is not like that. It is what it is.</p>

<p>Now, you can argue about representation. Stephen Pinker has opined that even the most abstract painting (say, applied in alternating squeegee strokes) is still a representation: of the artist's process, their thought process, or the artist themselves.</p>

<p>Which makes for a long page of quotes and speculations but very little specific opinion. I'm in a period of great activity right now -- both with the camera and without it. Maybe one requires the other. And a lot of thought about what it means, without a clear verbal answer but with enough internalized understanding to keep working obsessively every day.</p>

<p>Someone else can decide if it's any good but no one else is going to do it, so I set my alarm every morning and just get on.</p>
