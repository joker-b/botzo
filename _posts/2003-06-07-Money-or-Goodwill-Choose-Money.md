So <a title="FOXNews.com" href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,88620,00.html#2" title="I'm sorry, I really don't like to give crdit to FOX for anything other than random bursts of outrage, but even these guys can occasionally get the trivial news stories reported accurately">FOXNews.com</a> is deflating another Big Story, namely the Keanu Reeves <a href="https://www.botzilla.com/blog/archives/000085.html">"big giveaway,"</a> which they claim was simply an invention of the British tabloid press.

Guess we can all go back thinking Keanu's an overpaid block of wood masquerading as an actor, rather than a misguided but bighearted benevolent force.
