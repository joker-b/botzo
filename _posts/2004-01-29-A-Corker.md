So if you live in NYC, as I used to, you know what <a href="http://www.wfmu.org/">WFMU</a> is, and you probably know that they have an interview program called <a href="http://www.wfmu.org/special.php/SE">The SpeakEasy,</a> and you <i>might</i> even know that the hostess <a href="http://www.wfmu.org/playlists/SE">Dorian</a> has a habit of bringing photographers on the air to talk, without pictures, about pictures.

Recent guests have included Steve McCurry, Mary Ellen Mark, Jerff Meremelstein, Jonathan Torgnovik, Peter Howe, and <a href="http://www.wfmu.org/listen.ram?show=9021">Philip-Lorca di Corcia,</a> so very recently distantly parodied on <a href="/photo/corky2/">this very site.</a>

<a href="http://www.wfmu.org/listen.ram?show=9021">Di Corcia's interview</a> is in the true photrant tradition &#151; "Cindy Sherman... fruit flies have evolved more than her work" is just the tip of the iceberg. A worthy waste of an hour of your time.
