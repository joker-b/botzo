A part of this June’s <i><a href="https://artatthesource.org">Art at the Source</a></i> offerings will be a selection of new hanami images – specifically looking at cherry blossoms in the villages and forests of Japan's Kiso Valley and part of the Nakasendō route.

This pic from among the blossoms at Nagoya Castle won’t be one of them – it's a happily related extra.
