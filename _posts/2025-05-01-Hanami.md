At this June’s <i><a href="https://artatthesource.org">Art at the Source</a></i> I'll be showing new <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanami" target="_blank">hanami</a></i> images – specifically looking at the cherry blossom bursts of April 2025 in the villages and forests of Japan's rural Kiso Valley and part of the Nakasendō highway.

This portrait, made among the blossoms at Nagoya Castle, won’t be one of them – it's a happily related personal extra.
