Grr, last night while cleaning-up and filing-away the papers for my tax returns I find... the W-2's!

Not a huge disaster by any means, a pretty common error that the <a href="http://www.ftb.ca.gov/individuals/faq/ivr/613.html" target="linkframe">California FTB</a> and <a href="http://law.freeadvice.com/tax_law/income_tax_law/w2_tax_form.htm" target="linkframe">various other sites</a> say is simply an excuse for the various agencies to hold onto your refund for a longer time (but no obvious penalties, and for me at least, I'm already all paid-up and then some). <a href="http://eric.everydaylies.com/archives/000539.php" target="linkframe">Tsk.</a>
