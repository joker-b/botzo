Okay, so Saturday night.

We were at a little <a href="http://www.geekychick.net/blog/archives/000411.php">end-of-an-era party</a> for <a href="http://gretchen.pirillo.com/">Gretchen Pirillo</a> and (less-directly) <a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/">Chris Pirillo,</a> and run into
<a title="The Scobleizer Weblog" href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Robert Scoble</a> who is headed off to work for the Octopus that is called Microsoft. Convinced me more than ever that I really ought to have a good Tablet PC. With lots of, err, stuff. He does Tablet stuff right now, just around the corner from NVIDIA at NEC for a few more days. But fat chance getting a Real Deal! :)

I also fiddled around a bit (towards the end of things) with Chris's <a href="/photo/G2.html">Canon G3</a> in a much handier way than you can at Best Buy or Gasser's. Yeah, the G3's way faster than my <a href="/photo/G1links.html">G1,</a> but I already knew that. Courtney's Digital Ixus is faster than my G1. What I really liked was that the focus lock button was in a reasonable place, right under your thumb like it is on the <a href="http://www.contaxg.com">Contax G2</a> or an EOS camera. It has a light, natural feel.

But then... aggggh! <i>Canon's designers turned off the MF lock if the LCD panel is closed.</i> This is <a href="/photo/G1focus.html">just like the G1</a> and it ticks me off <i>so</i> much! It means you can't use the optical finder and focus lock together, unless you have the LCD spun-round and turned on. And if the LCD is turned on, then the shutter gets an additional lag for screen updating. Plus you get nose oil all over your LCD. Grrrr.

<i>Please someone, tell me there's a custom function to turn that behavior off...</i>

The G3 is definitely better than the G1, and its movie mode, size, and weight still make it an attractive alternative to a heavier SLR digicam like the 10D. I might trade up to one yet. But Canon still knows how to get me riled-up.
