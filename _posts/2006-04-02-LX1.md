![LX1]({{ 'https://www.botzilla.com/blog/archives/pix2006/P1000096-807.jpg' | absolute_url }})


This past week I received a <a href="http://panasonic.jp/dc/lx1/">Panasonic LX1</a>, my first non-Canon digital (other than a phone camera). Tiny, 8MP, Leica lens (essentially, it's identical to the <a href="http://www.leica-camera.com/digitalekameras/dlux2/index.html">Leica D-Lux2</a>) &#151; and 16::9 aspect ratio, which was the Big Deal for me. So far: though the pace is definitely slower (and the ISO's lower) than using a DSLR, as a pocketable high-quality camera: fantastico. Loving it.
