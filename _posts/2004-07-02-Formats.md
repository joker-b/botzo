<i>Three rolls TMax 100, Rodinal 1+50 8 mins; three rolls Tri-X @ ISO 250, Rodinal 1+25 11 mins...</i>

Sooner or later I will figure out how to make a photo that looks like over-exposed and over-developed Tri-X in Rodinal. And then hopefully I'll be able to shoot it with something as lightweight as the old <a href="http://www.netaxs.com/~cassidy/images/equipment/ql17/ql17.html" target="_blank">Canon G-III</a> (f/11 @ 1/500... you won't find a better camera or lens, and certainly not one within an order of magnitude of the price. And even then, it's grained-out Tri-X fer Pete's sake &#151; you HEGR-heads really think you're going to tell the difference between 130lpmm and 135lpmm on Tri-X?). Until then I guess I'm stuck keeping the film cameras around, eh?

My trick in printing this on the computer has been to use Vuescan with auto-levels set to their far extremes, store a 16-bit file, and then do the final contrast-range adjustments in Photoshop before downgrading to 8-bit. I've just had to accept that I can't get my head around Vuewscan's whitepoint/blackpoint adjustments enough to get predictable quick results. I'd rather burn the disk space for 18MB-per-frame scans and then do the work with a tool I feel I can control.
