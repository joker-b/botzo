The state publishes a PDF containing the <a href="http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/traffops/signtech/mutcdsupp/pdf/camutcd2012/Part9.pdf">2012 California Dept of Transportation Bicycle-Related Roadway Standards.</a> It contained, across several pages, all of the current standards for bicycle-related signage (and much more). I've collected the signs together here for easier web reference (fabric patterns, anyone?).

Note that the vague legacy "Share the Road" sign seems to be fading out, to be replaced by the much clearer "MAY USE FULL LANE." About time!
