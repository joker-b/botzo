<a href="http://www.bumbutz.com/">Cosmin Bumbut</a> and six photographer friends of the <a title="7 days photoclub | home page" href="http://www.7zile.ro/">7 days photoclub</a> have been spending just such a week annually for almost five years, in the more-traditional and remote parts of their country.
