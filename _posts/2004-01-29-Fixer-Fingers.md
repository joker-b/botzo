Amazingly, I still have a film backlog from November &#151; the three rolls now hanging are from a trip to <a title="Weblog Entry - 25/11/2003: Sunday" href="http://www.gaspweb.co.uk/plog/archives/000014.htm" target="linkframe" rel="met colleague">Speaker's Corner</a> and a following visit to <a href="http://www.skjaerven.com/" target="linkframe" rel="met colleague">Copenhagen.</a> Glancing at the negs it seems clear to me that I still have quite a ways to go with the DSLR before I'm as comfortable using it as I've grown to be with the <a href="http://contaxg.com/user.php?id=1678&page=user_images" target="linkframe">Contax.</a>

I've decided my next system expansion will be to hybridize slightly &#151; to take the advice of <a href="http://www.motorcycletours.com/northeastern/" rel="colleague" target="linkframe">Sean Reid</a> and, for about the price of the Canon 28mm &#131;/1.8, get the Contax 28mm &#131;/2.8 and an EOS adapter (Better sell the rest of that <a href="/blog/archives/000269.html">older Canon gear,</a> huh).

There's just comething about the Zeiss lenses, whether its the design or the coating I'm unsure, but it's there &#151; I could see it just glancing at the first roll of negs when I bought my Contax. They were visibly different from Canon negs, even before they were printed. Sharp? Snappy? Sure. But it's more than the <a href="http://www.photodo.com/nav/prodindex.html" target="linkframe">photodo</a> measurements, even as high as those are. Even <a href="http://www.canon.com/technology/interview/lens/index.html" target="linkframe">Canon's own lens designers</a> have said it: <i>"Sometimes what the eye perceives is slightly different from what is expected, even if all the measurements meet the proper values. We've experienced the fact that the perceptions of an expert surpass the precision of measuring instruments."</i>
