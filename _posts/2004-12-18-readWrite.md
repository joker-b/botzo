After a couple of weeks' struggle with Apache and EnSim the journal's active again (thanks Lynn for putting up with my many phone calls). By coincidence, I'd already started writing daily into a different journal &#151; a paper one. For all the value I get from my PDA, it's just plain rotten for writing. So I picked up a <a href="http://www.moleskine.com/eng/default.htm" target="mole">Moleskine</a> notebook to carry. I can't buy into all that Hemingway and Andre&eacute; Breton marketing, but it's well-suited for what I wanted, a notebook to scribble thoughts in when they're fresh, not after hours when I have time for the blog. And thoughts that might never be in the blog while I'm at it. It's silent, instant-on, lightweight, durable. I'm almost tempted to just switch the blog over to scanned pages from it.

Almost.

It's also a valid <a href="http://www.apug.org/forums/showthread.php?t=5903" target="mole">log book</a> for shooting &#151; not a log of the state of my camera settings, which I dutifully record using <a href="http://www.netacc.net/~rlmsmw/gpx_overview.htm" target="mole">GoPix.</a> Instead, I can use it to log something more durably important &#151; the state of my self.
