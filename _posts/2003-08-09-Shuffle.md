<a href="/photo/journal/jul03q-34.html"><img src="http://www.botzilla.com/bpix/jul03q-34.jpg" width=200 height=135 border=0 align="right" hspace=8 vspace=6 title="End of a Season (C)2003 Kevin Bjorke"></a>Slow but steady evolution: minor upgrades to the <a href="/photo/journal/">journal photo index</a> &#151; it already was being rebuilt daily (whether there were updates or not), but now the generated pages follow <a href="/blog/archives/000060.html">my own rule</a>: that <i>clicking on a photo in a gallery should move you to the next photo in that gallery.</i>

So simple, so obvious (you'd think). This small but significant change should make the photos much easier to see and navigate.

In addition, the order of links are now randomized at each daily rebuild; and if the photo was used in a journal entry, it will link to the appropriate comments connection.

Oddly, several of the MT templates that drive the management of this part of the site were corrupted in the past few days &#151; and corrupted spectacularly, a few 2K-9K files blossoming into multi-gigabyte binary junk. All should now be well.
