All these "one-off" rolls are killing my pace of processing. I usually prefer to do trios &#151; this one-of-a-kind backlog will take at least a week of steady attack to resolve, even if my schedule weren't so compressed.

<ul>
<li>1 Neopan 400@800</li>
<li>1 Neopan 400</i>
<li>1 Acros</li>
<li>1 Tmax 100 destined for Rodinal</li>
<li>3 Tmax 100 destined for Xtol (but one still in the camera)</li>
<li>1 Delta 400</li>
<li>1 Kodak Gold 100 (still need to find a good lab for this locally)</li>
</ul>

Yeah, it would all be easy in digital, blah blah blah.
