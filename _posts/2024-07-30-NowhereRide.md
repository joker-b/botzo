I spent the middle part of August traveling with my Brompton -- ths involved city riding, country riding, air travel, rail travel -- but no automobiles.

This was much easier than I anticipated. I response to some wueries about riding and some of my kit, here's a recap: bicycle, luggage, camera, and reflections on riding on the coast and in two European capitals: Amsterdam and London.

## Lesson: Pack for Your Goals

Originally, I planned for a month-long ride along the Welsh coast. With that in mind, I packed with a kit that could be 100% self-contained: I would depart the house by bicycle, with all my luggage, and return the same way.

Here's the kit, then: my Brompton stuffed into a [Vincita Sightseer bag,](https://vincita.cc/products/sightseer-3-5-travel-set) using my bike clothes as packing (Vincita's bag includes an internal garmet bag for this purpose), and everything else packed into a [Wotancraft 7L _Brompton-specific_ messenger bag.](https://www.wotancraft.tw/en/product/pilot-for-brompton-bag-7L-blackC) The only loose item would be my helmet, which I could wear when traveling by plane, train, or bus.

The original plan was not for a "photo trip" and so I carried only one camera with three small primes (28/50/90mm), my elderly but tiny [Edirol R-09 audio recorder,](https://www.roland.com/us/products/r-09/) and _no laptop._ Instead, I carried an iPad mini, a [pocket-sized bluetooth keyboard,](Fosmon Mini Bluetooth Keyboard) an [Inateck power-pass-through USB-C hub](https://www.amazon.com/Inateck-Multi-port-Gigabit-Ethernet-compatible/dp/B07C6NBZG5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) and a little Samsung T7 SSD for backups. More on all the eletronic bits later. This gear plus wallets, passport, first aid kit, [Midori A6 notebook](https://md.midori-japan.co.jp/en/products/mdnote/) and some pens left the bag lightweight with room to spare.

I did "modify" the bag in one respect: it comes with two detachable pouches, a drawstring lens/bottle pouch and a rectangular zip.  swapped the drawstring for another zipper pouch, which was much more useful since the bag already had a [water-bottle](https://shop.zojirushi.com/products/smkhe)-friendly pounch built in.

Wotancraft's add-on pouches can also be [detached and used as a bag on their own](https://www.wotancraft.tw/en/product/molle-accessory-pouch-black-canvas) - I brought one strap for this purpose -- istead of toting around my camera bag, I often found that carrying the camera on its own strap was fine, and then the small pouch could hold wallet/extra lens/recorder/batteries/notebook quite handily.

Here's all I needed to carry on-board my flight: basically just the one smallish bag, helmet, [noise-cancelling over-ear headphones](https://www.wired.com/2017/08/review-sennheiser-hd1-wireless-over-ear-headphones/) wrapped around my collar, and a sport jacket. 

For departure, I packed up the bike, rode to the bus station, and started to pack it up -- only to realize that I'd left part of the bicycle kit at home!

Thankfully, I'd been angling for a super-early bus, which left me enough time to unpack the bike, ride to the house, fetch the part, ride back to the bus, repack everything, and have time to meditate in the sun for a few minutes for the the 8AM-ish second airport-specific bus arrived.

At this point, I knew that the bicycle and clothes were all packed and wouldn't need unpacking until they arrived at AMS from SFO. As a last task before strapping it all down, I removed the roller-caster wheels, put them in a dedicated pouch, and slipped them down between the tires insde the bag. Done!

### Skidmarks 

From there, everything proceeded smoothly, until the airplane lost rudder control while traveling around 120 knots during takeoff -- the pilots responded by killing the engines and slamming the brakes. Everyone and every un-strapped thing was tossed about, the halted plane was surrounded by fire engines (thankfully no fire, and no one seriousy hurt), and the flight: cancelled until tomorrow.

Passengers were sent to a neighboring hotel; no luggage, just a happily-lightweight camera bag.

Which also meant no tootbrush, clothes, etc.  couldn't use the hotel laundry to wash what I was wearing, since I'd be left naked in the hallways.

The solution was to walk a mile or so to the nearest grocery store, buy the very smallest/cheapest liquid laundry soap I could find, then return to the hotel room. Ask for an extra bath towel (and a toothbrush!). Wash all of my clothes, one at a time in the sink with just a little soap, rinse them in the shower, then roll them up as tight as possible in the bath towels -- wringing them that way avoids severe creasing or damage to the clothes. Then I hung them up and in the case of the socks, inflated them for a few minutes using the hotel hair dryer set to "cool."



For public transit, eveything goes into the Vincita

Carry as little a possible on my person at airports.


This was not to be: the long time window was unvailable, and other concerns, even once I'd flown to Europe, kept my countryside riding time down to just a few days. I could and did, however, ride in the city.

A month turned into two weeks turned into barely half a week.




Packed-up on Pall Mall -- the extra backpack was requied to handle dress shirts, dress slacks, and extra shoes to ensure I was dressed acceptably for dinner in some locations. It opens like a suitcase and the stras stow so it can be (and was) checked as baggage.

Hills in Wales -- not really much different from the hills here in Sonoma County, where some UCI teams regularly train.
