I spent the middle part of August traveling with my Brompton -- ths involved city riding, country riding, air travel, rail travel -- but no automobiles.

This was much easier than I anticipated. I response to some wueries about riding and some of my kit, here's a recap: bicycle, luggage, camera, and reflections on riding on the coast and in two European capitals: Amsterdam and London.

## Lesson: Pack for Your Goals

Originally, I planned for a month-long ride along the Welsh coast. With that in mind, I packed with a kit that could be 100% self-contained: I would depart the house by bicycle, with all my luggage, and return the same way.

Here's the kit, then: my Brompton stuffed into a [Vincita Sightseer bag,](https://vincita.cc/products/sightseer-3-5-travel-set) using my bike clothes as packing (Vincita's bag includes an internal garmet bag for this purpose), and everything else packed into a [Wotancraft 7L _Brompton-specific_ messenger bag.](https://www.wotancraft.tw/en/product/pilot-for-brompton-bag-7L-blackC) The only loose item would be my helmet, which I could wear when traveling by plane, train, or bus.

The original plan was not for a "photo trip" and so I carried only one camera with three small primes (28/50/90mm), my elderly but tiny [Edirol R-09 audio recorder,](https://www.roland.com/us/products/r-09/) and _no laptop._ Instead, I carried an iPad mini, a [pocket-sized bluetooth keyboard,](Fosmon Mini Bluetooth Keyboard) an [Inateck power-pass-through USB-C hub](https://www.amazon.com/Inateck-Multi-port-Gigabit-Ethernet-compatible/dp/B07C6NBZG5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) and a little Samsung T7 SSD for backups. More on all the eletronic bits later. This gear plus wallets, passport, first aid kit, [Midori A6 notebook](https://md.midori-japan.co.jp/en/products/mdnote/) and some pens left the bag lightweight with room to spare.

I did "modify" the bag in one respect: it comes with two detachable pouches, a drawstring lens/bottle pouch and a rectangular zip.  swapped the drawstring for another zipper pouch, which was much more useful since the bag already had a [water-bottle](https://shop.zojirushi.com/products/smkhe)-friendly pounch built in.

Wotancraft's add-on pouches can also be [detached and used as a bag on their own](https://www.wotancraft.tw/en/product/molle-accessory-pouch-black-canvas) - I brought one strap for this purpose -- istead of toting around my camera bag, I often found that carrying the camera on its own strap was fine, and then the small pouch could hold wallet/extra lens/recorder/batteries/notebook quite handily.

Carry as little a possible on my person at airports.


This was not to be: the long time window was unvailable, and other concerns, even once I'd flown to Europe, kept my countryside riding time down to just a few days. I could and did, however, ride in the city.

A month turned into two weeks turned into barely half a week.




Packed-up on Pall Mall -- the extra backpack was requied to handle dress shirts, dress slacks, and extra shoes to ensure I was dressed acceptably for dinner in some locations. It opens like a suitcase and the stras stow so it can be (and was) checked as baggage.

Hills in Wales -- not really much different from the hills here in Sonoma County, where some UCI teams regularly train.
