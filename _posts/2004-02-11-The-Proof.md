Since I was <a href="/blog/archives/000277.html">asked,</a> here is a sample of one of the proof sheets I've been making using <a href="http://www.xnview.com">XnView.</a> The original is 3075&#215;2175 pixels, for printing at 300dpi. This is enough to see detail on the page. For a 100% detail showing the level of detail that's visible, just click-through on the image at right.

This week marks the last one of the <a href="http://www.sfmoma.org/">SFMOMA</a> show, <a href="http://www.sfmoma.org/exhibitions/exhib_detail.asp?id=108&click=arbus_from_homepage">Diane Arbus Revelations.</a> We've been there twice now. I'm tempted to return.

Some of the surprising things in the exhibit (which may be in the expensive companion book) are a few of Arbus's proof sheets. Some are about what you might expect: a suite of similar shots from which just <a href="http://www.masters-of-photography.com/A/arbus/arbus_twins_full.html">one</a> was selected. But for most of the others, what's astonishing is their variety &#151; proofs where each photo is markedly different, of a completely different person, sometimes in another location. The photos that were printed weren't one from a set &#151; they were just the one photo.

I know that Arbus was constantly dismissive of her ability to know what was in the photo until she saw it. But the proof sheets tell a different story. In, nail it, and go on to the next thing. Pretty impressive. Scary, even.
