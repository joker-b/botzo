Back in Sonoma County and jumping over many holes.

Events: in the past week I've shot several video interviews for other [_Art at the Source 2024_](https://www.artatthesource.org/) artists -- this has been a great experience, in part because their open-studio schedules are identical with my own -- I wouldn't otherwise have had a chance to see and discuss the work of artists [Tom Ballard](https://www.artatthesource.org/tom-ballard), Cheryl and Mikion of [Nichibei Potters](https://www.artatthesource.org/nichibei-potters), [James Reynolds](https://www.artatthesource.org/james-reynolds), [Jeremy Calnan](https://www.artatthesource.org/jeremy-calnan), or [Jenny Helbraun Abramson](https://www.artatthesource.org/jenny-helbraun-abramson) -- happily I also shot more video for my studio host: [Barbara Harris](https://www.artatthesource.org/barbara-harris). The videos produced will be circulating during the show.

But that's just part of it.

There are several art events around the bay area this weekend, so I took it on myself to promote at them, independently from the efforts of the AatS team.

* Sonoma Valley Authors Fest: books are the focus, and since I'm offering books this year, as mentioned in the last post of this series I've prepared a promo postcard specifically pitching the books. This was printed via Vistaprint and has arrived at the perfect time.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Authers Fest is a closed, private event, there is also a Saturday "Authors on the Plaza" -- the cards will be distributed there. They contain a link mentioning books, and a QR code that aims at a book-specific page on botzilla.com.

* Petaluma Art Center Idea Lounge: Cards can find a home there, too.

* SF Camerawork Book Sale: this surprise event starts on the 26th of April, so I'll be bringing some promotional cards.

* SF Art Fair: tougher nut to crack. We'll see! Maybe time for some guerilla marketing.

In tandem with the card, there's now a book-specific page and an updated separate page for each book.

## Web Changes

The planned switchover to the Ghost platform is still pending -- I'd hoped to have it done before this week, but... circumstances. As a temporary measure, the new pages _do_ have a link for contacting and subscribing. What they don't yet have is a stable method for ordering and purchasing.

## Book Designs

The hardcover edition of _[Forgotten Signs]({{ site.url}}/signs)_ is now on its way.

A hazard for books is that people may browse through an entire book and then set it aside. Now it's.... a used book. Ive heard about this issue from several small publishers, who don't sell a book once someone has thumbed it, and then, in some cases, the bookstore sends it back because it can't be sold.

Given the narrow margins of small-run books (unless I wanted to charge more to compensate -- but I'd prefer not) I'm going to borrow a strategy first described to me by photographer Ed Thompson -- bag the books. People can look at prints, which are wrapped protectively, or they can purchase a book _with_ a print, or... it stays in the bag.

The hardcover books I've pritned arrive shrinkwrapped -- the others will be wrapped by hand, each with a signature and stamp.

## Card Designs

In addition to books I'll be offering some mages as cards and card sets. The first is a repurposing of what I'd called _The Bear Project_ in previous entries: it's now _[Resting Bear Face]({{ site.url}}/rbf)._

There will be six cards in the set. In a bag, or with an editioned print.

## New Artwork

As planned, I did make an entirely new piece for the Art at the Source SCA gallery show and reception. Not as planned, in the middle of the work I veered to one side and made a very different piece, not _quite_ to my original remit but better as an artwork. I hope you'll get a chance to see it at SCA.

It was a bit of a rush again -- while the work is due at SCA on the 7th, the paperwork for it, including title and dimensions, had a surprise (to me) deadline of 23 April. If I hadn't also been pushing at a lab's lead-time calendar, I might not have made it.

Likewise, aperwork for "side exhibits" was due at the sametime. Those side exhibits have tighter size constraints, which prevnet me from offering any of the larger aluminum works -- instead I've chosen a photo from _Havana: Caged Bouquet._

It might seem odd that I would include a more conservative piece like that, but it will be entirely alone in a different venue, miles from SCA. For that particular venue, it felt right.






The works to be completed in the next days are the final hardcover _Forgotten Signs,_ which is easy, and the very difficult and complex foldable design for _Market Hours._

Still to come if I dare to risk limiting proofs: _Wisdom of the Elders,_ and the newer projects I'm calling _Cryptotheology_ and one I'm temporarily calling _The Bear Project._ 



## Web Design

The card also needs _another_ QR code to track those specific visitors (to let myself know if this worked at all), and -- the biggest lift -- a move of the entire website that will allow subscriptions and online pre-ordering.

At this moment, this looks like a move from the current [Jekyll](https://jekyllcodex.org/) web platform to [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) is the most flexible and quickest.

The shift will be in stages, with essential content moved to Ghost before switching the [DNS `A` entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System), verifying that [email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MX_record) services haven't been upended, then trickling-in all the missing articles one by one once the most-important URLs -- key articles that get more traffic, AATS and book links, Chartthrob and other tools -- are sure to be working (alog with appropriate aliasing for old URLs which will have new URLs).

This means that some older posts (there are hundreds) may be offline for a bit -- posts with complex animated embeddings and slideshows are the most challenging but important to get right.


## Studio Days Presentation

The works for my internal promo video need to be clearly identified and labeled and the video including those label codes produced. This has been less urgent than book designing, but needs completion before mid-May because it coordinates other tasks.

I'll need to sort my payment-acceptance regimen (including online) and will start collecting the necessary paperwork for a printed "gallery list" at the site: that is, a paper listing with image thumbnails, prices, and the occasional "sold" marks, should any be needed.

## Printing

Photo printing, matting and bagging will need to go into production mode after the 14th or 15th. My current estimates are for around 100 new prints. At four good ones per day that's a month of printing, so I do need to raise my output rate.

### Print Authenticity

Prints usually involve editioning and various marks of authenticity, ranging from a signature to elaborate holographic cryptographic keys. We'll skip the latter, but I'm experimenting with both hand-stamped and hand-embossed brints or book pages. _If_ they look good.

## AatS Support and Bureaucracy

Bits and bobs: the AatS catalog has been proofed -- and changes requested. Their website: changes requested. Festivals and farmer's markets: upcoming. It's a lot of work for everyone, especially given the addition of more artists from new parts of the county for 2024. Those paper catalogs should start appearing in venues around the bay around the same time as the Author's Festival.

The overall event is manned by the collective of participating artists: I've also got upcoming promotional work for the collective coming up, probably in the form of video production. Should be fun!

See you at Studio 16B on June 1st.
