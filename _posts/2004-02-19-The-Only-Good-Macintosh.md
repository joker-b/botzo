...is a live Macintosh, which mine was <i>not</i> for the past 24 hours. To be fair, it was the IBM disk that spontaneously failed, not the Apple hardware &#151; so it was Apple's OEM purchasing managers who were twits, not the manufacturing folks.

My last backup was at New Years, so essentailly all mail I've recevied since December and before yesterday is gone &#151; I especially apologize to a couple of folks who were bidding on some older camera gear, whose names and mail addresses I've now lost. I've swapped out the old G4 for a dual-G4 tower, and the disk was fresh-formatted today &#151; really starting from nearly scratch.

Fortunately almost all photo stuff &#151; and all original files and/or scans &#151; were already on CD and/or on the hardy and dependable Windows machines. Never thought I'd say that.
