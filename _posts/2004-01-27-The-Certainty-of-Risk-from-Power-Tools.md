![Landscape with Power Tools, (C)2004 Kevin Bjorke]({{ 'http://www.botzilla.com/bpix/landPower.jpg' | absolute_url }}){: .align-right}
I've enjoyed Michael Johnston's <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/columns/sunday1.shtml">Sunday Morning</a> columns for the past couple of years &#151; back in 2002 he published a short list of book titles that he considered crucial for "practicing photographers." Some I had read, and others I logged-away in my PDA for future reference. I generally trust Michael's opinions on photography as being reasoned and informed, even if they don't <i>always</i> coincide with my own (He also was the one who, through <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/auteur.shtml">this article,</a> got me going on a chain of links to <a href="http://www.johnbrownlow.com" rel="colleague" rel="friend">John Brownlow</a> and the <a href="http://topica.com/lists/streetphoto/read">streetphoto list</a>).

In the past couple of weeks I unearthed that list again, and reserved the titles I hadn't read through <a href="http://www.sjlibrary.org">the San Jose State University Library.</a> this morning I also discovered that Michael had posted an <a title="Amazon.com: Listmania! Readings for Practicing Photographers" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/listmania/list-browse/-/31FU4AMPS7WBN/102-4493296-7912915">Amazon "Listmania" version of the very same list,</a> along with a couple of bonus titles.

What I like about his list is that with one exception, it's not about cameras. With one exception, it's not about film. And in several cases, not <i>directly</i> about photography at all. And in one case (Robert Adams's <a href="http://www.aperture.org/books_details.php?book_id=32">Beauty in Photography</a>), I'm not even sure the photo book isn't really about something else. 

The book that has struck me as most broadly-useful to the day-to-day world beyond photography is David Pye's <a href="http://wingide.com/pipermail/py-design-forum/2003-September/000188.html">The Nature and Art of Workmanship,</a> a title that, as the link illustrates, has far more applicability that its original nominal topic of woodworking. I'm surprised this book isn't better-known.

It's ironic that within pockets of resistance to digital photography and printing, such as <a href="http://www.apug.org/">APUG,</a> one of the shared myths is the notion that digital photography replaces craft with computer software. Pye's woodworker's perspectives, published in 1968, can function as a powerful broom on such mental cobwebs.
