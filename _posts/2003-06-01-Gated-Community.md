![Golden Gate, May 2003 (C)2003 Kevin Bjorke]({{ 'https://www.botzilla.com/bpix/may03i-22.jpg' | absolute_url }}){: .align-right}
<i>Three rolls Delta 400, 11.5 mins @ 20C Xtol 1::1. Mixed at 24C, brought the temperature down by tossing some ice cubes in a baggie and floating it in the already-diluted Xtol.

Yesterday afternoon I spooled about 20 rolls of Delta from a 100' bulkroll &#151; as I was cranking along, I read the Ilford label for the box, which recommended Xtol 1::1 for Delta 400 at no speed slower than ISO 500... 13 mins @ 20C. Hmmm, wonder why they don't like Xtol?</i>

When I was living in Marin, I started work on a collection of photos of the Golden Gate bridge. Shot quite a few. My thought was to do something faintly echoing Hiroshige's <a href="http://www.japaneseprint.com/fuji.html"><cite>36 Views of Fuji.</cite></a> One or two "straight" shots of the bridge itself, and all the rest photos of the city and countryside surrounding it, with the bridge merely a constant presence. The I moved to Hawaii and had to set this project aside.

In the meantime, what appears in the bookstores but <a href="http://www.eyestorm.com/feature/ED2n_article.asp?article_id=150&caller=1"><cite>Golden Gate</cite></a> by Richard Misrach. For a while, I feared that his book (and show) were exactly what I had planned &#151; I've since discovered differently, even as I've returned to Northern California.

It's natural to want to complete this project, though my photography is now in a very different ideological place. The greatest change w.r.t. my initial charter has been the growth of a deeper understanding (or belief that I have one, anyway) in the way Hiroshige was able to use Fuji-yama as a universal symbol of Japanese-ness. I began to see, in a less-than-superficial way, that Hiroshige's illustrations were not of Fuji, but under the eye of Fuji.

I also came to question the role the Gate has. While physically imposing, <a href="http://www.sfbaybloggers.com/">a common iconographic symbol for the bay,</a> what does the Gate represent? A tourist attraction, a real estate boon to Southern Marin, a tax harbor and absurd privilege to members of the bridge commission, tempting terrorist target? Is that what I want to accomplish, to celebrate, to reveal?

I'm still interested in the idea of this project, but even as the questions become sharper the answers recede.
