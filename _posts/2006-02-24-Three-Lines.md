![Three Lines]({{ 'http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Thoreau.jpg' | absolute_url }}){: .align-right}
Another ten-day delay. Like everything, I can find a reason.

In a recent post-new-year's post on <a href="http://www.4sfolders.com">43F,</a> Merlin linked to <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Walden_-_Economy">Thoreau's <cite>Walden,</cite></a> which to my (not great) surprise exists in its entirety on Wikisource. The section Merlin was quoting from is the introductory chapter, "Economy," which in turn contains the famous line: <cite>Most men lead lives of quiet desperation.</cite>

Like most Americans, I was given this to read and ignore when I was 14 years old. Y had been mentioning Thoreau too, just a few days ago. So the coincidence prompted me to re-read it, and I was struck by both the sentences before and after the famous line above:

<!--more-->
After: <cite>What is called resignation is confirmed desperation.</cite> What a subversive hippie, that Thoreau.

But the line that hit closer to home was the one before:

<cite>As if you could kill time without injuring eternity.</cite>

A sentiment very near and dear to me.

I didn't make any New Year's resolutions, I had already made a basketful of them a couple of months earlier. And one of them: never be bored, and never do something out of simple boredom. There's no reason for it, always more opportunity for interest, and given the known-to-be-finite amount of time we all have here in the universe, why waste even one minute more than we have to? So: I've been busy.

Next post, coming rather sooner, will touch on three of the people I happened to encounter these past ten days.
