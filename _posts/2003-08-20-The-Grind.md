<i>Three rolls of Delta 400, 15:30 in Xtol 1+1 &#151; ISO 800 to bring-up some underexposed frames on one roll. The rest can deal with it.</i>

My 90mm Sonnar seems to have developed "the grind." It focuses smoothly when the Contax is held normally, but vibrates noisily when the camera is held vertically (or upside down) when focusing at near distances. Hard to tell if it just needs to distribute the lubricants or if there's something more seriously awry. *sigh* just a week before leaving town. Then again I use the 90mm rarely.

The Canon is a different story &#151; I still enjoy using that old FD 85mm, the oldest SLR lens I own. As much as I would like to consolidate entirely on rangefinders, the SLRs still have a few spots where they excel, albeit noisily. One of them is closeup, wide-open. The 50mm is also excellent for this sort of shooting.

In the morning, the world is a blur. I've worn glasses since the age of eight and to me, soft-focus wide-open closeup work is how morning looks. Until the glasses go on, the world within two feet is clear and the rest... a study in smooth <i>bokeh.</i>
