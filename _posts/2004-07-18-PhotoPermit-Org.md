It's been two weeks since the <a href="/blog/archives/000329.html">last entry</a> &#151; while work has consumed a lot of that time (accomplishing a lot of fun stuff, I might add), some of the time has also been spent creating a new parallel website &amp; forum to discuss issues of photography in the context of civil liberties. Please visit our new site, <a href="http://www.photopermit.org">PhotoPermit.Org.</a>
