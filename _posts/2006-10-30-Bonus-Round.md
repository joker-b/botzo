Last night as I was wandering back to the hotel and wandered through a few pachinko and pachislot halls, I was struck by the people who were <i>watching,</i> like the guys in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2006-10-29-Perfect-Foods %}">this photo.</a>

Inside the parlor I could understand &#151; the players' friends or whatever. But what about the folks gazing steadfastly from outside, through the windows?

My initial reaction was that the players they were watching &#151; at that hour near 9PM, mostly older folks &#151; were seasoned, expert players. That the spectators were watching to see How It's Done in the same way that I used to lurk in video arcades watching as some over-caffeinated guy ran the score up to the max 99,999 playing <i>Defender.</i>

Considering I'd always thought of pachinko as strongly random, I realized that there were subtleties of the game far beyond my grasp. <i>What could I be missing?</i> I asked myself while watching a grayhaired lady dump another plastic cup of balls into the hopper on her machine, her attention too focused to notice the unlit dead cigarette still in her mouth.

But a morning later and the meaning of my looking (and my pictures) has already changed as I've learned to reinterpret those "seasoned" players as <i>kamo</i> &#151; suckers &#151; and the spectators as "hyenas," waiting to move in if the <i>kamo</i> loses big and leaves an unplayed bonus round.

Another lesson in how photography &#151; like all observations &#151; can be so easily upended and all our intentions for it thwarted.
