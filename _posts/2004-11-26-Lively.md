I haven't written much about work at <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/" target="nv">NVIDIA</a> recently, mostly because the <a href="http://developer.nvidia.com/" target="nv">developer web site</a> contains plenty of publicity information and technical information about what I've been doing, as occasionally does the gamer co-site <a href="http://www.nzone.com/" target="nv">nZone</a> &#151; the company already does a great job of P.R. without my little blogging contribution. Still, I wanted to hype some of the work the Demo Group has been doing. Among their many creations have been the two NVIDIA signature characters, <a href="http://www.nzone.com/object/nzone_nalu_downloads.html" target="nv">Nalu the mermaid</a> and <a href="http://www.nzone.com/object/nzone_dawndemo_home.html" target="nv">Dawn</a> the fairy (and her "evil twin" <a href="http://www.nzone.com/object/nzone_duskdemo_home.html" target="nv">Dusk</a>).

Recently Dawn and Dusk leapt out of their regular roles as PR models for NVIDIA and have taken on a new role working with the band <a href="http://www.mtv.com/bands/az/evanescence/artist.jhtml" target="nv">Evanescence</a> over at MTV &#151; as the featured players in what I think is the best-ever clip from MTV's show <i>Video Mods.</i> <a href="http://www.mtv.com/onair/dyn/video_mods/videos.jhtml" target="nv">Click here</a> and look for "Bring Me To Life" to see the video. Go ahead, compare it to the rest &#151; this is the immediate future of realtime entertainment.

Dawn is also now in the running for <a href="http://www.missdigitalworld.com/MDWContest/showpage/24?modelnr=178" target="nv">Miss Digital World,</a> over in Italy. Check out the contest and vote for her....
