Right on the heels of my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2004-01-30-So-Much-Confusion %}">previous post</a> about DSLR circles of confusion and sensor size, Canon goes and releases (well, leaked) news of the 1D Mk II, with an 8MP sensor and a new multiplier factor: 1.3&#215; &#151; my guess got the exact sensor size wrong, but the trend (and apparently price) just about nailed.

So much for Canon going the EF-S or Four-Thirds route &#151; they're clearly headed in the direction of full frame for the line.

This will play a bit of extra havok with the lens market, which can only sell more lenses for Canon (and a few for Sigma and friends). That 50mm is now a 65mm, getting right into Leica R "normal" territory. And the 20mm is genuinely a wide lens again. I wonder how many 16-35 and 17-40 zooms will pop up on Ebay later this year.
