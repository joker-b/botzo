## Post-Opening, Yet A Week and a Half to Go

As of today, the last of the art materials needed for Art at the Source have arrived: a resupply of _Graffiti Generations,_ a batch of letter-sized matte board from Archival Concepts, several boxes of Canson Baryta paper from B&H, and after a short drive, a stack of cut mats (two sizes) from Redimat.

Yesterday, a package of clear bags from clearbags.com. All tested, verified fits for all books, cards, and more than a few prints.

Last week I started the AatS-dedicated printing in earnest: print selections from each book were made, and in some cases, images from each project that were _not_ in the books -- sometimes a favorite picture just doesn't fit among the others for the book. But as prints, these "outtakes" can find their own futures, including as companions... to the books.

The prints I'll be showing for AatS come in these size ranges:

* Around 8x10 sized, in 11x14 mattes or sleeved.
* Around 12x18 sized, matted.
* Around 16x20 sized, loose or matted.
* 24x36" aluminum prints in editions of ONE.
* 32x48" aluminum prints in editions of ONE.

The books are available in a variety of common sizes, each according to the content.

## The reception

* Received well?
* Didn't get to talk to people about my piece, because... tehy wanted to talk about their piece.
* Still no video
* Still no setup for Square or online oredering 
* still need signage to be done
* Started setting up Propanels
* Still need to make "Folder" video
* thankful for the holiday - work collisions
* RBF Caption Contest
* Art Trails (a different location)
* Cards Distributed
* Inspiration: Pier 24
* Website Shuffling
* American Graffiti.. past. Peggy Sue... ahead!
* Post-Event Plans
* Artist statement from Reception
* Series without books: e.g. CT1, Collectors, what else?
* Photos that are "unaligned" like "Anchor"
* photo demonstrations at AatS? How?





These posts tend to emphasize marketing and promotion over the creation of original work. Yet they are always integrated: in collecting photos from my _Humdingers_ project, and thinking more deeply about their presentation and _"who are these for?"_ the selection process is clearer, the ordering more sensible, and in at least this case, the title has changed, to [_Grafitti Generations._]({{ site.url}}/generations)

The timing is less-than-stellar, I realize: the annual ["Salute to American Grafitti" event](https://americangraffiti.net/) is next weekend and it's very very unlikely that I'll have books on-hand to sample. The reality of a busy summer.

However, I've started getting nibbles on the "Click here to get updates" buttons so I know there is an audience for this book, these photos.

Slightly related, another summer-photography tentpole for me is Santa Rosa's [Peggy Sue Cruise.](https://www.cruiseforpeggysue.com/) It occurs on the final Saturday of Art at the Source, so on June 8th I'll be quick to close-up shop and roar over to Santa Rosa mid-event. The cover shot of _Grafitti Generations_ was made during that cruise: during the multiple loops, I've often seen the show cars adding passengers, especially kids. 

### Preview Reception

For the single small print shown at the Gallery One preview, I'd planned to use a very easy-to-look-at one from [_The Caged Bouquet_]({{ site.url}}/cage) but as delivery-to-gallery day approached I realized: when presented without context, it's just too easy for a viewer to interpret it as "attractive person looking attractive" which was not at all the point of the project nor of my broader post-teenaged photo-making.

Instead the same dancer is present in the background of a different photo with other cast members of the Ballet Naci√≥nal de Cuba's production of _Giselle,_ along with interesting backlight, catholicism, memories, anticipation and motion. As someone who cares about narrative-like relationships within and between images, it's better.

I know some advisors may feel differently: more people might like the first one better in isolation, but pleasing the most idle casual eyes with colorful candy is not the goal. There's no shortage of those kind of photos, I don't need to contribute there.

Both photos, with context, are in [the book.]({{ site.url}}/cage)

## Web Changes & Technicalities

[See See]({{ site.url}}/seeseelo) pointed out some problems with the existing [Jekyll "collections" method](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/) for organizing images -- it jumbled-up [her paintings]({{ site.url}}/paintings) on some versions of the Safari browser. I fixed it, and once I did, applied it to [the book page here.]({{ site.url}}/book24)

This new edition of collections not only works correctly on iPhone and iPad, it adds a `rank` option so that you can re-order the collection any way you want, not just by title or date.

## Book Designs

The hardcover edition of _[Forgotten Signs]({{ site.url}}/signs)_ has arrived, looks good. The printer didn't offer a paper wrap half-cover, so I still have to design and print one on a different paper -- having the physical books will make it straightforward to measure and fit. I hope.

As mentioned above, [_Grafitti Generations_]({{ site.url}}/generations) is in-flight, due back from the printer _just a tiny bit late_ (2 days?) for the annual _Grafitti_-themed event. Looking on the bright side, maybe more people will drive to Sebastopol.

_Minor Chaos:_ I very nearly forgot to order the [_CHAMPIONS_]({{ site.url}}/champions) books after the test prints! Fortunately I did a check of the stock in time or I'd have only four copies; I need to hold a couple aside, since there might an opportunity to get some to the team management after AatS (tbd).

## Promo Cards

It should be obvious, but I carry these everywhere, give them away freely. I also carry a small package of thumbtacks, so they can be added to community bulletin boards and the like as I encounter them.

While the obvious venues for promotion are "art zones" like art centers, camera and art-supply stores, etc., I don't really think they're the best. If someone is already buying oil paint or lenses, they aren't likely to buy artworks -- they're buying _materials._ They want to make things (or at least own the tools) themselves.

The more-likely audiences are people who are interested in the content of images: Giants fans, car show lovers, and their many friends.

One of the primary incentives for exhibiting at "Art at the Source," for me, is to find and connect to audiences who really don't care much about algorithms or print colors or Leica. I love these things, you might too. We are a narrow minority.

I've also posted the cards (err, pictures of them) on [the socials]({% post_url 2024-03-20-Ditching-Facebook %}) in the past week, in as focused-audience a manner as I can.

## Cards - the Other Kind

The _[RBF]({{ site.url}}/rbf)_ note cards have arrived, and look good.

A second set of art cards, with the working title of "Joker B's" should also be ready before the studio days.

## New Artwork for the SebArts Gallery & Preview Reception

Arrived, and delivered to the gallery!

As I was leaving the gallery delivery someone trotted out from the back to catch me: "hey, that piece is really neat!"

Hope you visit the gallery and agree!
