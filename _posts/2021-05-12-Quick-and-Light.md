Visitor above the bird feeders.

Weird but true department: a Fuji dedicated flash is my favorite for these non-dedicated Leica hot shoes.

Maybe making up for the fact that Leica makes the best strap for Fuji, but I use a Fuji strap on the M5 (it has weird lugs). And the 28mm finder that Fuji made for the X70 is perfect for the 28mm M-Rokkor.

Anyway, the flash: Fujifilm EF-X20.

No one seems to make little flashes like this any more: small and with manual controls. Contax used to make teh TLA200 but like most things Contax it's turned into a desirable fashion accessory: well over $200 for a decent-<i>looking</i> copy, and since it uses pricey hard-to-find CR2 batteries, you can't handily recharge. The Fuji uses rechargeable AAA's and btw, it's also a perfectly good dedicated Fuji flash.

In the not-so-electronic days, there used to be little calculator sliders and dials on flash units. I made a spreadsheet for this one, it's <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sxqd_ZHqzXUJZuiFlLL7VVdgwp3hViXtNEsi47nRxM8/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> on Google Docs. The only part I pay attention to is the chart for ISO 400, which looks like this:

So, if you're usually prefocused in the range of around two meters, you should dial the flash down to 1/4 power at around f/11, or to 1/16 for about the f/2.8-ish range... you're good to go. The precision is usually close-enough and is probably what you'd get from a non-TTL sensor anyway. Use this chart even a few times in practice, and you'll likely be able to remember it for your favorite ISO without looking.

For walking around using Tri-X, I'd go for about 2 and a half meters, f/8, quarter power, _done._

If you're going for the Bruce Gilden look and have a mechanical camera with a low-speed flash sync, you'll need to crank it up to f/16 and maybe even add a filter to not blow-out in daylight. How about backlit, yellow filter, two meters, half power, see what you get?
