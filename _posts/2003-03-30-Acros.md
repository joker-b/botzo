<i>One roll Acros, two rolls Tmax 100, Xtol 1::1 9.5mins. I forgot about the mystery red stain from the TMax (anti-halation layer?). One Neopan400 rated 800, Xtol 1::1 11.5 mins.</i>

Acros has a unique snap, described well by one early reviewer as "metallic." I've never run any charts on it, but suspect it's just that it blocks-up in the highlights, similar to slide film. Anyone know?

I can say this much &#151; dries faster than Kodak, probably due to the plastic film base. This is ready to scan and sleeve after 4-5 hours, while the Tmax is still a wee bit sticky and still hanging.
