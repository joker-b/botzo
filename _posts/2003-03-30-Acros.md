Acros has a unique snap, described well by one early reviewer as "metallic." I've never run any charts on it, but suspect it's just that it blocks-up in the highlights, similar to slide film. Anyone know?

I can say this much &#151; dries faster than Kodak, probably due to the plastic film base. This is ready to scan and sleeve after 4-5 hours, while the Tmax is still a wee bit sticky and still hanging.
