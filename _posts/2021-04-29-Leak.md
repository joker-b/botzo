Light leak. You can barely see it here, up the middle of the frame. Of all the rolls I've run through my old CL thus far, only this _one_ roll shows a leak. Later or earlier: nada.

On this roll, the leak's spaced between multiple frames: three apart, then six, then eight... and each time, from early frames to later, it moves to a different location, each becoming smaller for the higher-numbered photos. 

My guess: a pinhole-sized burst of light got into the film takeup chamber, late in the roll. Maybe from the frame counter. The dot of light scattered down an angle into concentric, more-tightly-wound, parts of the film.

And maybe this was just for a brief moment -- most frames, no problem. Later rolls: great. Either way, annoying. A cost for using this little 50-year-old box.
