As I've <a href="/searches.html">mentioned elsewhere on this site,</a> I keep a little robot that tracks down links, picture theft, usage of pictures, pages, and also the <a href="/searches.html">search terms</a> that people use on search engines like <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="linkframe">Google</a> and <a href="http://www.kartoo.com/" target="linkframe">Kartoo</a> to find pages here on <a href="/index.html">Botzilla.</a>

In the past few days I've seen a sudden surge in <i>one</i> search term, that had never been present before: "Saddam Art." This one, along with variations like "Saddam Art Collection" and "Hussein Artworks" and "painting of Saddam Hussein." have shot to the #1 spot in the past week.

I actually don't have much in the way of Saddam art, though I've <i>wanted</i> some since well before Iraq invaded Kuwait. In the late 80's there was to have been a show of, as I recall, impressionist masterworks to be held at a new state-run museum in Baghdad &#151; the first show of its kind anywhere in the arab region. Scholars were greatly excited and paintings were being loaned from numerous high-profile institutions. Then, near the last minute, the show was canned, and replaced with a show of paintings by sundry Iraqis of the Beloved Leader, Saddam Hussein. Almost immediately the show was declared to be permanent, and the museum to be dedicated to this one exhibition. I really wanted <i>that</i> exhibition catalog!

Guess Saddam couldn't stand being one-upped by <a href="http://www.writersofthefuture.com/lrh/asi/" target="linkframe">L. Ron Hubbard.</a>

In the last few days, as the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A7135-2003Apr21.html" target="linkframe">Washington Post reports,</a> Iraqi artists are starting to deal with an Iraq free from government minders. No telling what has happened to <a href="http://www.webprowire.com/summaries/311155.html" target="linkframe">Salaam Abid,</a> one of Hussein's favorite full-time portraitists.
