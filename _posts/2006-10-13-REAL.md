As mentioned a few days ago this has been a 3D animation sort of week. I'm taking a break tonight but expect there to be more over the weekend. I'm working in multiple packages: <a href="http://www.softimage.com/">XSI,</a> <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/3dsmax">Max,</a> and <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/maya">Maya</a> &#151; animating and setting up shader networks in XSI, modeling and animating in Maya, consolidating and scene-building in Max. A bit like working out tunes on piano (or trumpet) so you can record them on guitar. The hardest part is dealing with it at a finger level: holding down Alt in XSI instead of hitting "s" and that sort of thing. Videogames have stabilized on some key combos, like the first-person-shooter combo of 'asdw' &#151; but not these apps. Not yet.
