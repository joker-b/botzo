<p>I was reading a recent <a
href="http://artforum.com/inprint/id=5497"
target="linkframe">ArtForum article</a> about moblog photos, and
the reviewer hit upon a key word: <b><i>inessential.</i></b> Photos that
run counter to the notion of "a perfect flower," they are just: "a
flower." They don't contend to any special uniqueness or
meaningful significance. They're just tonight's dinner, or the
cat. They're even less momentous than old snapshots &#151; at
least old snapshots were made on someone's birthday or on the
family's Grand Canyon roadtrip. Moblog photos tend to be
somewhere even less worthy of inspection, between snapshots and
the dull gray eye of a security camera. And there's a lot of
them.</p>

<p>After seeing <a
href="http://www.botzilla.com/blog/archives/000150.html">Luis's
quote of Robert Frank</a> from the 1958 <i>U.S. Camera
Annual,</i> a quote I've seen often kicked around, I thought I'd
go find the original. I found one in the <a
href="http://www.botzilla.com/blog/archives/000120.html">San Jose
library.</a> The due-date stamps showed that it had last been
checked out in 1986. And there in the middle was Frank, first
with a brief writeup by Walker Evans, then a pretty hefty slice
of the then-yet-to-be-published <i>The Americans</i> (one shot
rudely clipped-out of the book &#151; wish I knew which one), and
then Frank himself. His comments are brief, just a page.<p>

<p>Frank wrote in his Guggenheim application of his desire... <i>"To
produce an authentic contemporary document, the visual impact
should be such as will nullify explanation..."</i> The first half
surely fits the moblog aesthetic, but what of the second?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>I have a genuine distrust and "mefiance" toward all group
activities. Mass production of uninspired photo journalism and
photography without thought becomes anonymous merchandise. The
air becomes infect with the "smell" of photography. If the
photographer wants to be an artist, his thoughts cannot be
developed overnight at the corner drug store.</i></p>

<p><i>I am not a pessimist, but looking at a contemporary picture
magazine makes it difficult for me to speak about the advancement
of photography, since photography today is accepted without
question, and is also presumed to be understood by all &#151;
even children. I feel that only the integrity of the individual
photographer can raise its level.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Frank's still out there, wandering New York or the wilds of
eastern Canada. Wonder if he has a celphone cam.</p>
