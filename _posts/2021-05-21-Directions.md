<center><i>Neopan, YashicaMat 124G</i></center>

This $150 Yashica has been with me since high school -- hokey meter, questionable low speeds, flare and all. I've scrounged-up most of the original accesories, one at a time. I even have the user manual, which contains banal sample holiday snapshots, maybe made at Marine World. Only years later did I recognize the byline on those photos: Weegee. Wait, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weegee"><i>Weegee?</i></a>

Truthfully, away from strong light directly into the lens and above Æ’/5.6, it's hard to imagine wanting to replace this camera with anything fancier. Just be careful about the direction: don't point it into the sun. Or a flash bulb, Weeg.

Apparently <a href="https://jeromedeperlinghi.com/portfolios/portraits-1994-2011">all of these more-recent celebrity portraits</a> were also made with the same model Yashica.
