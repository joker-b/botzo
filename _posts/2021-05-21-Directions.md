<center><i>Neopan, YashicaMat 124G</i></center>

This $150 Yashica has been with me since high school -- hokey meter, questionable low speeds, flare and all. I've scrounged-up most of the original accesories, one at a time. I even have the user manual, which bizarrely contains example banal holiday snaps. Only years later did I recognize the byline on those photos: Weegee. _Weegee?_

Truthfully, away from strong light directly into the lens and above Æ’/5.6, it's hard to imagine wanting to replace it with any thing fancier. Just don't point it into the sun. Or a flash bulb, Weeg.

Apparently <a href="https://jeromedeperlinghi.com/portfolios/portraits-1994-2011">all of these</a> were also made with one.
