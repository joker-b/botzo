High speed ftw! A quick $12.99 sale price later, and the LX2 is somewhere between 25-30% faster on RAW capture. Thank you <a href="http://www.ocztechnology.com/">OCZ</a> and thanks Gary for the hint!

To my surprise, shooting time for ten "high quality" JPEG images remained about the same -- around 20 seconds -- indicating to me that for compressed pix, the limiting factor is the speed of the "Venus Engine" processor itself.

<i>Addedum: yesterday saw the publication of <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sigmadp1/page7.asp">dpreview's test of the Sigma DP-1</a> which is probably the closest competitor to the LX-2 and considered by many, in anticipation of it, as the compact streetphoto heir apparent. To my great surprise, the Sigma is <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sigmadp1/page7.asp"><b>significantly slower</b></a> than the <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasoniclx2/page5.asp">LX-2</a> -- the only got a little over 7 seconds per frame in RAW while the LX-2 turnaround was only 4.5 seconds (even faster than what I was getting). The Sigma <b>does</b> have a three-frame buffer, though it's not clear to me if you can use it in regular shooting mode. And a hotshoe for Martin Parr & Bruce Gilden fans.</i>

<i>Addendum #2: And on the heels of <b>that,</b> another review lamenting the DP-1's lack of speed, this time by Edward Taylor on <a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2008/05/sigma-dp1-updat.html">The Online Photographer</a> -- "My main complaint about the camera then was that it was painfully slow. It was and it is...." Hmmm.</i>
