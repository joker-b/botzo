In the past couple of days I've run across notices for two established and Contax-related sites &#151; based on photos, not gear.

<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/features/story/0,11710,1134509,00.html">An interview with Luc Delahaye</a> talks about his experience shooting, among other things, his series "Wintereisse," which was reputedly made with the G2. <a href="http://www.magnumphotos.com/c/htm/TreePf_MAG.aspx?Stat=Photographers_Portfolio&E=29YL53IQ2XU">Delahaye</a> also is no slouch when it comes to kicking over a few cans around the <a href="http://www.magnumphotos.com">Magnum Agency</a> crowd, with comments like "<a href="http://www.magnumphotos.com/c/htm/TreePf_MAG.aspx?Stat=Photographers_Portfolio&E=29YL53IQ1W7">Cartier-Bresson</a>... didn't really need to put the film in the camera &#151; the importance for him is the act of taking pictures ... being in the right position and being fast." 

(Supposedly <a href="http://www.magnumphotos.com/c/htm/TreePf_MAG.aspx?Stat=Photographers_Portfolio&E=29YL53UIS@8">Josef Koudelka</a> had a similar moment of Magnum-founder-busting, leaning into frame during a Cartier-Bresson TV interview to say "Henri, you are <i>so</i> full of it!")

Or again from Delahaye: "[<a href="http://www.terra.com.br/sebastiaosalgado/">Salgado</a>]...  is a clich&eacute;-maker. He is producing what everyone has in mind." Another good healthy Photo Rant.

Best of all, the photos are terrific.

On the other side of the planet is our own Contax homie <a href="http://contaxg.com/user.php?id=1023" rel="colleague">Eddie Ng,</a> whose <a href="http://www.walkeast.com/">website</a> I've just found featured in the December issue of the UK <a href="http://www.gmcmags.com/bw/index.html" target=linkframe">Black and White Magazine.</a> I've known enough to mark his site (even without an RSS feed) on the PhotoRant <a href="/blog/archives.html">blogroll</a> for a long time.
