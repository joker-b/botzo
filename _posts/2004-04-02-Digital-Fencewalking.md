Folks are occasionally surprised to hear that I acquired my 35mm <a href="http://contaxg.com/user.php?id=1678">Contax G</a> in early 2002, a year <i>after</i> my digital <a href="/photo/G1links.html">Canon G.</a> I got the digital in the hope of supplanting my 35mm SLRs, but instead found it in turn supplanted by a 35mm rangefinder.</p>

<p>I tried to carry the digital every day &#151; every day I found myself losing shots. Now I carry the Contax every day, and the sense of lost shots is far more rare.  It's simply more capable: instant-on, predictable focus, dependable, fast.</p>

<p>I expect to return to the digicam fold sooner or later, of course &#151; fact I get terribly impatient with it. I ran into <a href="http://www.echeng.com/photo/">Eric Cheng</a> over the weekend &#151; was toting-along the current leader of the pack, a Canon D1s with a hefty zoom. It looked reasonably fast, and even pretty quiet. The color from it looks crisp and clear. But it's still huge & costs more than a new Kia. Argh.</p>

<p>C'mon Contax/Minolta/Konica/Nikon, where's that "digital Hexar"????</p>

<p>Ah well, time to stop typing & go get fixer on my fingers.</p>
