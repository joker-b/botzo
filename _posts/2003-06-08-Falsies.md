Almost Monday and time for another <a href="/photo/salon/">Streetphoto Salon.</a> This week I actually had a photo at the ready, shot just a day or two before the announced theme: <a href="/photo/salon/bjorke_reflect.html"><i>Reflection.</i></a>

I must admit to feeling a bit awkward, having approached the theme in what looks like a straightforward, literal manner. Still this one does contain a bit of the layering of images and images of images that I seem to like these days, not far from the <a href="https://www.botzilla.com/photo/journal/IMG_8184.html">"palindrome of indirectness"</a> I made for John B's Shell Game.

Honestly, the photo isn't entirely made of reflections. It's a multiple exposure of different reflections. No intrusive Photoshopping &#151; it's all there on the negative &#151; but not as it appears at first glance.

And no, it's not the <a href="/photo/journal/jun02b-01.html">photo on the right.</a> Surprising myself, it's yet another color shot. You'd think this ambiguity schtick would always lends itself to black and white....
