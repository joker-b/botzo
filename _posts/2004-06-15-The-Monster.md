![12mm, Subaru]({{ 'http://www.botzilla.com/bpix/monster.jpg' | absolute_url }})


...has arrived, the big "popeye" <a href="http://www.sigmaphoto.com/html/zoom_intro.htm" target="_blank">Sigma 12-24mm zoom.</a> It's a full-frame 35mm lens, though on my digi its range is 19-38mm. Ran a bunch of shots through it right away, anxious about reports that some copies were soft in the corners. Not this one! It performed well for every aperture, with a minimum of barrel distortion too.

At last, a proper wide angle view for the DSLR. I am <i>so</i> digging it. But the size &#151; yeow!

The 300D with the twin batteries and the <a href="http://194.100.88.243/petteri/pont/Reviews/a_Sigma_12-24_f4.5-5.6/a_Sigma_EX_12-24_f4.5-5.6.html" target="_blank">Sigma</a> weighs in at 1630 grams &#151; compared to the Contax G2+21mm which is just barely coat-pocketable (if you take off the accessory finder) at around 700 grams. A different animal, I know, I know. And it's less weight than a <a href="http://www.nikonians.org/html/resources/nikon_articles/body/f5/f5-3.html" target="_blank">Nikon F5</a> (a little). Kinda of the same feel when it's strapped on your hand, though. It could be a camera, or it could be a cudgel. It sure isn't going into any coat pocket I own.

In fact I can't get it into my camera bag, either. On its side, it's 2/3 the length of my <a href="http://www.saundersphoto.com/html/domkest.htm">Domke F6</a> and too tall nose-down to fit. I can't believe I'm going to have to bring back the big lunking Domke F2 bag, which I'd put away, to accomodate just <i>one</i> lens and body (okay, I should be able to squeeze a strobe and another lens in there too). I will <i>not</i> buy another bag just to house this thing!

Biggest difference between photography, live-action filmmaking, and computer graphics:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in CGI, <i>no schlepping.</i>

I swapped-in the infamous <a href="http://www.bahneman.com/liem/photos/tricks/digital-rebel-tricks.html" target="_blank">Russian hack firmware</a> for the 300D last week &#150; ISO 3200, 1-shot focus, Flash Exposure Compensation, and a working Av-mode flash (10D-style custom function, locks the shutter at 1/200)... what's not to like?
