While I've been a member of <a href="http://www.last.fm/">last.fm</a> for months, I never really used it because frankly I almost never use iTunes as anything but a cataloguer for my real player &#151; an old 20G iPod. Yet between my false start and now, there was a new development: <a href="http://homepage.sunrise.ch/mysunrise/ph_waeber/audiopod/">Audioscrobbler submissions for iPod.</a> Joy! Now at last I can start building a station &amp; you can <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/bjorke/">be my friend.</a>
