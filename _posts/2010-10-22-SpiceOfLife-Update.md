Sometime it's hard to just let something be what it is, so I added a bunch of features to the <i>Spice Of Life</i> sketch. The OpenGL part is little changed, but the "built with Processing" part got expanded to make it simpler and self-explaining for users/players.

A nice thing about Processing is that sketches can <i>usually</i> be easily re-factored as web-browser applets. Having some issues with this one, sadly (and only on <i>some</i> computers), so I can't just post a playable applet on botzilla (yet).

Here's a video instead -- rather than a help screen, you'll see that <i>SoL</i> tries to guess what you're doing. This is a direct capture, though you can't see the mouse cursor.
