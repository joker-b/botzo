Picking through proofs I've found a stretch of photos that I'd essentially forgotten &#151; the ones that were made in the weeks immediately preceding the arrival of my DSLR. Like this one. Funny how I can tell myself that materials are secondary to ideas but it's surprising, looking through these shots, how many ideas that seemed important at the time were completely dropped when the New Toy came along.
