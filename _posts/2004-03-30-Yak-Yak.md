I'll be speaking next week at the March meeting of <a href="http://la.siggraph.org/" target="linkframe">L.A. Siggraph,</a> on the topic of connections between realtime game-level computer graphics and the highest of the high end in movie special effects and animation.

Among other highlights, expect to see a closeup view of the new NVIDIA development tool, <a href="http://www.fxcomposer.com/" target="nvidia">FX Composer,</a> the best tool yet for developing FX and Direct X HLSL shaders for use in interactive games, tools, and programs of almost any kind.

The following week, I'll be giving a talk at GDC 2004 &#151; the annual <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/" target="linkframe">Game Developers' Conference</a> in San Jose. Be up bright and early at 9AM Wednesday for <a href="http://www.cmpevents.com/GDx/a.asp?option=3&V=11&SessID=2501&Mgt=0&RVid=0" target="linkframe"><i><b>Cinematic Effects II: </b>The Revenge</i></a> &#151; and the next day for yet another, different talk (this time on some Image-Based Lighting tricks), as part of the flurry of activity surrounding the release of our latest book, <a href="http://developer.nvidia.com/object/gpu_gems_home.html" target="nvidia"><i><b>GPU Gems:</b> Programming Techniques, Tips, and Tricks for Real-Time Graphics.</i></a>
