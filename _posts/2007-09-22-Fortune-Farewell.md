In the morning I'm off to Japan. I stopped at Kinokuniya in San Jose today, to see if there were any interesting recent Japanese art books I could buy <i>here</i> and thus not have to carry around while I'm wandering -- guided by my earlier acquisition of their entire collection of <a href="http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?an=kawauchi&sts=t&tn=cui+cui&x=0&y=0">Rinko Kawauchi</a> books.

To my delight, I found a brand-new copy of <a href="http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?sts=t&tn=farewell+photography&x=0&y=0">Farewell Photography,</a> selling for un-marked-up retail. Yatta-w00t!

I'll be back the first week of October, just in time to see Kawauchi in person at SFAI.
