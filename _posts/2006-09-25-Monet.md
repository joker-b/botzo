A few days before I <a href="/blog/archives/000509.html">failed to go to the show</a> at the SF Legion of Honor, Garrison Kiellor ran the following poem on his daily radio show, which I only heard via podcast later. By further concidence the poet, Howard Nemerov, is the brother of photographer Diane Arbus and uncle of Amy.

<b>Monet</b>

<i>Unable to get into the Monet show,<br />Too many people there, too many cars,<br />We spent the Sunday morning at Bowl Pond<br />A mile from the Museum, where no one was,<br />And walked an hour or so around the rim<br />Beside five acres of flowering waterlilies<br />Lifting three feet above their floating pads<br />Huge yellow flowers heavy on bending stems<br />In various phases of array and disarray<br />Of Petals packed, unfolded, opening to show<br />The meaty orange centers that become,<br />When the ruined flags fall away, green shower heads<br />Spilling their wealth of seed at summer's end<br />Into the filthy water among small fish<br />Mud-colored and duck moving explorative<br />Through jungle pathways opened among the fronds<br />Upon whose surface water drops behave<br />Like mercury, collecting in heavy silver coins<br />Instead of bubbles; some few redwinged blackbirds<br />Whistling above all this once in a while,<br />The silence else unbroken all about.</i>
