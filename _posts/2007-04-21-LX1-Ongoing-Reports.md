Whaddaya know, the new issue of <cite>Consumer Reports</cite> has arrived and what do they pick as their favorite compact camera? The LX2, the latest variant of the <a href="http://www.botzilla.com/blog/archives/000479.html">LX1 </a>(bigger LCD, higher res, higher ISO's, but the same lens, UI, and camera frame).

I couldn't help but get a smile out of their pic, though: <i>what's she looking through?</i> 

The weird part is, I was just getting ready to blog about that topic anyway: not <cite>Consumer Reports,</cite> but viewing with the LX1 (or LX2, or Leica D-Lux2, or D-Lux3).

At this point I pretty-much know what the field of view is (especially given how much hipshooting I've done), just looking around. I can "see" the picture in front of me without any camera, so I've found it's comfortable enough to just <i>pretend</i> there's a viewfinder. No glued-on dots or minifinder, just hold the camera up near where my eye is (without <i>covering</i> the eye, as <cite>CR</cite> has bizarrely done), and go ahead & shoot. I can see the top of the lens to ensure me it's pointing straight, and a bit of the LCD glow gives me some vague notion about the luminance (which I usually ignore &#151; can't turn it <i>off,</i> alas -- gaffer tape and a bit of black paper to the rescue?).

And then yesterday, I finally got to reading <a href="http://www.reidreviews.com/">Sean Reid's Review of the D-Lux 3</a> and he's commenting on the lack of detail in any LCD screen. Second-Opinion co-reviewer <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10268776@N00/">Mitch Alland</a> has his own VF/LCD take, where he say his use of the LCD is mostly about gross-scale framing, and that (somehow) he too uses his un-VF'd eye a fair bit (though not, I think, the way I'm showing here).
