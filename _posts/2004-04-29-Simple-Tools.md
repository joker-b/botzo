<i>Three rolls Tri-X, Rodinal 1+50, 13 minutes.</i>

So after <a href="/blog/archives/000302.html">much anxiety</a> in the end it'll be the DSLR with a minimal complement of lenses and a film rangefinder loaded with Tri-X for this trip &#151; enough is enough (besides, <a href="http://blog.geekychick.net/">Courtney</a> will bring her camera, and we have the DVcam). Using the Contax over the weekend reminded me just how much more fluid and easy it is to handle than the digital. It also hammered home to me just how crudely abstract Tri-X and Rodinal can feel after many weeks of smooth, digital color. Which is a <i>good thing.</i>

Off to Florida and the Caribbean for a week, then &#151; we leave the house and web in the able hands of the fantastic <a href="http://elkit.blogs.com/">Elke.</a>
