<p>As many people have discovered, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2005-10-04-Memento %}">Alec Soth</a> now has a <a href="http://alecsoth.com/blog">blog</a> and is one of the <a href="http://www.jmcolberg.com/weblog/archives/002331.html">many fine photographers now writing about their work (and a bunch of other stuff).</a></p>

<p>Alec hasn't just appeared in his own blog, of course. Here's a snip from the <a href="http://blogs.walkerart.org/visualarts/?p=51">Walker Arts Center blog</a> which I like a great deal:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>This is totally corny, but the way I think about it is I really close my eyes and I try to imagine an exhibition of pictures and see what kind of pictures &#151; what is it I really want to look at? &#151; and then go try to make those pictures. You never make those pictures, because they just don't emerge that way, but it takes you on a path. Recently, I was in Georgia and it was the beginning of a commission. What did I want to photograph? Like, I'm interested in hermits. So I do a little Google search on 'hermits,' 'Georgia.' And I find this Greek orthodox monastery in rural Georgia, and I go there and have this amazing encounter with these people. Those pictures weren't in my head &#151; Greek Orthodox monks &#151; but something developed and it took me on this crazy path.</i></p></blockquote>
