Bjorke"></a>In <a href="/blog/archives/000304.html">yesterday's entry,</a> about (among other things) the documentary <i>Good Morning Afghanistan,</i> I didn't mention a minor character who appears on the scene a couple of times: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Rashid_Dostum" target="linkframe">Abdul Rashid Dostum,</a> who has split the country in two yet again with his recently-declared "North Zone of Afghanistan." Dostum is as deserving of contempt as any of the various parties in a state of continuing war in Afghanistan, right alongside charmers like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulbuddin_Hekmatyar" target="linkframe">Gulbuddin Hekmatyar,</a> the warlord most-responsible for the current state of Kabul (most of the city reduced to piles of tan brick).

I noticed Dostum, but didn't mention him yesterday because it wasn't significant to my point. But today he's at it again, as <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=586&ncid=586&e=6&u=/nm/20040408/wl_nm/afghan_dc" target="reuters">this Reuters story, dated today</a> tells &#151; he's sent his personal army into the city of Maimana, to take authority of the provincial captal away from the federal authorities. So the Karzai government, US-installed and US-backed, is facing a more open form of regional, tribal rebellion than ever before &#151; it's just like old times, with many of the same characters (as Hekmatyar taunts from the Pakistani frontier sidelines, perhaps in the company of Mullah Omar and Osama bin Laden).

Oh, did I say... "US-backed"? <i>What was I thinking?</i> Where the heck is this story on CNN, or Fox, or MSNBC? There are no sports stars of celebrity couples to be found in a backwater like Maimana. <i>LA Times?</i> Nope. <i>NYT?</i> Fuggedaboutit. AP has the story too, but no one in the US seems ready to run a story about yet another failure to "bring democracy to the region." <i>Nothing to see here, move on.</i>

I'm starting to worry about looking at tomorrow's media, if this pattern keeps up.
