In the spirit of the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-05-14-Impatient %}">previous post about impatient film photography,</a> I tried using a "proper" digital camera and macro lens to scan these negatives, rather than a phone. Shot them right through the PrintFile page, still in their sleeves -- on very close inspection you can see occasional tiny bubbles and reflections from the transparent sheet.

Even with that interference, the results lets the snappiness of the original lens shine through: the Zeiss 50mm Planar ZM, a close cousin to the Zeiss 45mm Planar that I've been so happy with on the Contax G.

The setup:

* Original Shot:
  -  Zeiss Planar 50mm Æ’/2 + Yellow filter on Leitz-Minolta CL (great combo!)
  -  Ilford HP-5+ in X-tol 1+1, all very vanilla.
* "Scanning":
  -  Nikkor 55mm pre-AI Micro-Nikkor w/extension tube + Fotodiox adapter on Leica Monochrom M246.
  -  USB-powered LED Light Box (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EBA8ZX8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1">$19.99!</a>).
  -  Bogen 3050 tripod (large, heavy, old).

The process is very quick, and if I had a proper copy stand the negative would probably even be well-aligned. Instead, I used Photoshop's Perspective Crop tool to get it straightened. Still, for a quick online-quality version of the film-based shot, this does quite nicely.

As for <a href="Terrafugia">Terrafugia's research center:</a> sadly Geely have moved operations to China. No more flying cars in our neighborhood. I still see a couple of autogyros occasionally whining over the neighbors' houses.
