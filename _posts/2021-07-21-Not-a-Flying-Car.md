In the spirit of the previous post about impatience, I tried using a digital camera and macro lens to scan these negatives. Right through the PrintFile page: on very close inspection you can see occasional tiny bubbles and reflections from the transparent sleeve. Even with that interference, the result lets the snappiness of the lens shine through: the Zeiss 50mm Planar ZM, a close cousin to the 45mm Planar that I've been so happy with on Contax.

The full setup:

* Zeiss Planar 50mm Æ’/2 + Yellow filter on Leitz-Minolta CL.
* Ilford HP-5+ in X-tol 1+1, all very vanilla.
* "Scanning": Nikkor 55mm pre-AI Micro-Nikkor w/extension tube + Fotodiox adapter + Leica Monochrom M246
* ME456 A4 LED Light Box (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EBA8ZX8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1">$19.99!</a>)
* Bogen 3050 tripod (large and old)

The process is very quick, and if I had a proper copy stand the negative would probably even be well-aligned. Instead, I used Photoshop's Perspective Crop tool to get it straightened. Still, for a quick online-quality version of the film-based shot, this does quite nicely.

As for <a href="Terrafugia">Terrafugia's research center:</a> sadly Geely have moved operations to China. No more flying cars in our neighborhood. I've seen a couple of autogyros whining over the neighbors' houses, heading up toward Cotati, however...
