A few days ago on <a href="http://www.PhotoPermit.org">PhotoPermit.Org</a> I posted about <a href="http://www.photopermit.org/archives/000054.html">Matthias Bruggman's run-in with El-Al</a> over their refusal to let him fly while carrying a big, scary, Canon 1Ds.

As a pleasant surprise, <a href="http://www.boring.ch/matt/static/archives/2005/01/on_the_way_back.html">Matthias's blog entry from yesterday,</a> "on the way back," is a fine slice of topnotch photo ranting about images, their potential for meaning and perception (whether it was there in the moment of photographing or not), on violence, romanticism, and Sebastaio Salgado. No wonder people are afraid of his sharp lenses and perceptively hi-res sensor.
