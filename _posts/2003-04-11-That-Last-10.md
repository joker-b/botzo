Picking through <a href="http://www.davebeckerman.com/general/JournalJune01.html" target="linkframe">Dave Beckerman's Journals</a> on his printing process. Yeah, a lot of steps, many things to go wrong.

The darkroom here is partly re-assembled. I put the Durst back together, but the head wouldn't light. Not sure if it's the bulb, the wiring, a fuse in the power supply, or what. I only got to use this enlarger a very few times at the old house &#151; it's nicer than I remembered (if it will work).

The water situation in the new space is poor. That's still the biggest limitation, one I've previously been able to bypass by just running negs in the kitchen and scanning them at my desk.

Overheard a conversation last week, two illustrators discussing one illustrator's desire to take a photo class. The other thinks it's a waste, "not that photography isn't an art and all, but I don't see how it has any effect on being able to make pictures."
