Ah, those scamps at <a href="http://www.foto8.com/">foto8.</a> No sooner have the pixels dried from <a href="/blog/archives/000503.html">this previous post</a> than I receive the latest "Industry" issue of <a href="http://www.foto8.com/ei8ht/index.html"><i>EI8HT,</i></a> in full-color glory and sporting a Polish mine worker on the cover, shot by <a href="http://www.vjirasek.com/">Vaclav Jirasek</a> as part of a series that follows on the heels of an earlier one, which he made in the 90's in black and white.

To turn the ironic screw just a wee bit further, the same issue of <i>EI8HT</i> contains more <a href="http://www.georgegeorgiou.net/">George Georgiou</a> photos, this time also working in color, from the streets of Kiev. "In Transit" indeed.
