On the first strip it's evident that the Intel box is faster, though the Eizo Flexscan monitor I have on that box is clearly no match for the Sony mounted over here on the Mac.

Beats me where the Vuescan "B/W Curve" pulldown went, though. You mean... I'll have to read the manual?

Zealous Mac switchers (and you know who you are) needn't be too alarmed, however &#151; the Mac is still running Photoshop, and it's about to be swapped-out for a dual-head G4 of more recent vintage. Moving the scanner just frees-up the Macs for more-productive tasks.
