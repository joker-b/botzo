<a href="http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/demos/resize/fix/">Fluid is the new Black</a> goes the saying of the day, but for Botzilla the main message is: <i>get over it.</i>

By that, I mean that if the site needs to work on all possible screen sizes, for future-friendly leanings, then: the pictures are just going to have to be small. And there's the rub for a photo site -- when the pictures are reduced to being upgraded versions of the thumbnails, not the other way 'round. This is tough, and frankly I won't give up without a fight for getting the best possible photographic presentation into place.

At the moment, I'm getting cozy with this little bit of CSS:

<pre>img { max-width: 100%; }</pre>

Which is a trick to ensure that images are resized downwards as their containers shrink.

The obstacle on a site like Botzilla is that most photo &lt;IMG&gt; tags have both WIDTH <i>and</i> HEIGHT properties specified, so that when displayed on a small screen, "max-width" alone doesn't get you very far -- the images don't scale uniformly down, but instead simply compress horizontally, untill they're long tall sticks.

JQuery to the Rescue!

Including this as the first line in my <tt>ready()</tt> function does the trick:

<pre>$("img").removeAttr("height");</pre>
