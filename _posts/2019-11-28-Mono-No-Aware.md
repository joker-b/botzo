A slice of American <i>mono no aware</i> amid San Francisco's building boom.

I don't mean to be _too_ cryptic: 物の哀れ, or _mono no aware_, is a Japanese (obviously) term meaning "the feeling of a thing" or "things." As far back as _Tale of Genji_ the expression has also taken on a role to describe a kind of pathos, a reminder of the transitory nature of all that we know, all that we do, from the tiniest cracking of an egg to the neo-Ozymandian ruins of Chernobyl.
