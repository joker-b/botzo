So there was a civil trial this morning that slightly shifted-around the schedules of the children but left most everything alone, at least in day-to-day terms. We'll finally have entire family weekends, for the first time in eight years. As I often say, the domestic courts are upside down. Eight years of court appearances as punishment for the sentence I've already served. Frustratingly, I didn't get a chance to report today on half the <a href="http://samvak.tripod.com/faq5.html" target="_blank">abusive,</a> <a href="http://www.bpdcentral.com/resources/abuse/evabuse.shtmlhttp://www.bpdcentral.com/resources/abuse/evabuse.shtml target="_blank">ridiculous</a> <a href="http://bipolar.about.com/msub-dual.htm" target="_blank">crap</a> that we've had to go through &#151; no time, water under the bridge, I'm just a big crab you know. Bleah. I could go on about biases in "the system" w.r.t. <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/dadsinfamilycourt/" target="_blank">dads</a> or <a href="http://www.atheistalliance.org/library/NeedForOrgs.htm" target="_blank">religion</a> or any number of things but in the end it's just a lot of running around and running up bills for very little accomplishment.

Now that it's over (again), for the first time in weeks (actually, since January of 2003) I can feel comfortable sitting down to read a book or a newspaper and not be worrying that I should really be working on evidentiary documentation or writing declarations and statements. And if this crap ever comes back, I've got plenty of information ammo already stacked up in the garage.

I also learned an extremely valuable lesson: <i>always call the police.</i> Giving people any slack for abuse is not ever an acceptable option. Ever. And never again.
