I've updated <a href="http://www.botzilla.com/blog/archives/000544.html">ChartThrob,</a> my little tool for creating digital negatives. The latest edition has some subtle internal tweaks that should enhance its compatibility with Macs (and users who have radically different default Photoshop preferences than my own).

You can find a nice description of how to use ChartThrob in a complete alt-process workflow <a href="http://www.inkjetnegative.com/images/RNP/quick_guide_to_making_digital_ne.htm">here on inkjetnegative.com.</a> Props to Michael for creating that page!
