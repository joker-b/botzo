...and no simpler.

This post is a brief -- and simple -- guide for Leica M-mount lens user to shoot photos using their lenses on the L-mount Lumix S5II.

All S5 variants have essentially the same controls, so this guide also applies to the original S5 and newest S5IIX. In spirit if not specifics, it applies to Sigma or Leica cameras too.

I'm posting this minimal guide because there's really very little practical information about using M-mount on L on the net, even today, 8 years after L-mount was introduced. There are <a href="https://youtu.be/p3-DWpYhuNU">advertisements,</a> sure. But quick practical guides? Didn't find one.

The purpose here is to _add_ the L camera to your existing M system -- not to replace it. When shooting events, I use two bodies, with different lenses, and want a smooth mental transition when I switch. _Keep it simple._

You may eventually use all of the tricks and video methods in <a href="https://help.na.panasonic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DCS5M2_DVQP2839ZA_ENG.pdf">the 800+ page user manual,</a> but for a  familiar shooting experience, applying a very few simple one-time settings will provide a solid, fiddling-free workflow for M-lens photography.

## Three Basic Steps:

<!--more-->

Obviously you'll need a **mount adapter.** I bought the Leica one, others may be okay. When it's connected the camera automatically knows to use manual focus. To make the experience more M-like, three things:

1. **Close the flippy screen.**

2. **Swap the functions of the front and back dials, so the shutter speds are on the front:** instead of the default which puts the aperture on that dial. For M lenses, you're setting aperture on the lens, not the camera. So the front dial is a more natural place for the shutter speed (the M5 has a similar placement). To swap the dials (this is the _only_ deep menu-dive in this guide), press **MENU->Gear Icon->Dial Icon->"Dial Set."** and then **"Assign Dial (F/SS)"** and choose **"SET 3".**

3. For manual focusing, **zoom the "punch-in" magnifier all the way in:** press the magifier button (AF pattern, a rectangle with a little cross inside) and then using the dials (there's an on-screen guide) zoom it in to maximum (6x) magnification. Just leave the magnification at 6x  from now on. Remember, you have an M lens and it still has a focus scale. We're not replacing it. Just shoot the way you're already used to.

With those tweaks, the S5II should already feel pretty natural in the hand for manual shooting, M-style.

### Extras

Of course, anything can be improved. Let's add a bit of optional polish, to keep your eye at the viewfinder while shooting, rather than looking at menus:

* The **exposure preview** button, on the front of the camera near your right middle or ring finger: I like having "shutter speed preview" set to ON. Poke the button repeatedly if you want to alter it, then leave it alone.

I use four **custom "Fn" button settings** for manual photography. Specifically, the otherwise-unassigned directional buttons embedded in the large dial around MENU button at the back. Once set, they're easy to use without having to look away from the viewfinder.

You can assign each Fn button by pressing it for a couple of seconds: when a menu appears, select the feature you like and touch MENU to save your selection.

* The "up" button to control the **Metering Mode:** spot, average, etc.

* The "right" button to call up or dismiss a live **Histogram** (it's usually off).

* The "left" button to call up the **Lens Information** display -- this is a list of lenses you can assign to the one(s) you commonly use, including a name that will be written into the EXIF of your image files.

* The "down" button: **Focus Peaking ON/OFF.** Focus peaking is great, except when it's distracting. Which is a lot of the time (especially if you're shooting with wide lenses or at, say ƒ/11 instead of ƒ/2). By placing the on/off control at your thumb, peaking is very quick and easy in operation -- unlike using the M Visoflex that requires taking the camera away from your eye and finding the setting in a menu.

You've reached the end! **_That's the entire guide._**

All of the other Lumix complexities: style settings, video frame rates, highlight metering, 96-Megapixel shooting, touch screen buttons, stabilization, user menus, bluetooth, tethered shooting, "expressive" scene filters, autofocus lenses, video LUTs, etc etc -- can come later. There's still the rest of that 800-page manual waiting for you, after all.

For now, go make pictures.
