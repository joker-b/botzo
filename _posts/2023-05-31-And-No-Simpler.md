...and no simpler.

This post is a brief -- and simple -- guide to start photographing stills using Leica M-mount lenses on the L-mount Lumix S5II. All S5 variants have essentially the same controls, so this guide also applies to the original S5 and newest S5IIX. In spirit if not specifics, Sigma or Leica cameras too.

I'm posting this minimal guide because there's really very little practical information about using M-mount on L on the net, even today, 8 years after L-mount was introduced. There are <a href="https://youtu.be/p3-DWpYhuNU">advertisements,</a> sure. But quick practical guides? Didn't find one.

The purpose here is to _add_ the L camera to an existing M system -- not to replace it. Keep it simple. You may eventually use all of the tricks and video methods in <a href="https://help.na.panasonic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DCS5M2_DVQP2839ZA_ENG.pdf">the 800+ page user manual,</a> but for a more classic shooting experience, a very few simple one-time settings will provide a solid, fiddling-free workflow for M-lens photography.

## Three Basic Steps for M users toward feeling at home with the S5II:

<!--more-->

Obviously you'll need a **mount adapter.** I bought the Leica one, others may be okay. When it's connected the camera automatically knows to use manual focus. This is the first and only _required_ step, but to make the experience more M-like, do three things:

1. **Close the flippy screen.**

2. **Swap the functions of the front and back dials:** put the shutter speed on the _front_ dial. For M lenses, you're setting aperture on the lens, and the front dial is a more natural place for the shutter speed (the M5 has a similar feel). Yes, you'll need to look at the screen to see the shutter speed value - no top plate like the one on the Leica SL2. To swap the dials (this is the only deep menu-dive in this guide), press MENU->Gear Icon->Dial Icon->"Dial Set." and then "Assign Dial (F/SS)" and choose "SET 3".

3. For manual focusing, first press the **"punch-in" magnifier** button (AF pattern, a rectangle with a little cross inside) and then using the dials (there's an on-screen guide) zoom it in to maximum (6x) magnification. Just leave the magnification at 6x  from now on. When you need critical focus, punch-in. Remember, you have an M lens and it still has a focus scale. We're not replacing it. Shoot the way you're already used to.

With those few tweaks, the S5II should already feel pretty natural in the hand to someone used to manual shooting.

### Extras

Of course, anything can be improved. Let's add a bit of optional polish, to help you keep your eye at the viewfinder while shooting, not looking at menus:

* The **exposure preview** button, on the front of the camera near your right middle or ring finger: I like having "shutter speed preview" set to ON. Poke the button repeatedly if you want to alter it.

I use four **custom "Fn" button settings** for manual photography. Specifically, the directional buttons embedded in the large dial around MENU button on the back. They're easy to press with your thumb without having to look away from the viewfinder. By default those buttons are unassigned, so setting them doesn't alter anything else on the camera.

You can assign each Fn button by pressing it for a couple of seconds: when a menu appears, select the feature you like and touch MENU to save your selection.

* The "up" button to control the **Metering Mode:** spot, average, etc.

* The "right" button to call up or dismiss a live **Histogram** (it's usually off).

* The "left" button to call up the **Lens Information** display -- this is a list of lenses you can assign to the one(s) you commonly use, including a name that will be written into the EXIF of your image files.

* The "down" button: **Focus Peaking ON/OFF.** Focus peaking is great except when it's distracting, which is a lot of the time (especially if you're shooting at, say ƒ/11 instead of ƒ/2). By placing the on/off control at your thumb, peaking use is very fluid in operation -- unlike, say, the peaking on the Visoflex that requires taking the camera away from your eye and finding the setting in a menu.

**_That's the entire guide._**

All of the other camera complexities: monochrome or color style settings, video frame rates, highlight metering, 96-Megapixel shooting, touch screen buttons, stabilization, user menus, bluetooth, tethered shooting, "expressive" scene filters, autofocus lenses, video LUTs, etc etc -- can come later. There's still the rest of that 800-page manual waiting for you, after all.

But to get started with your M lenses: just follow the guide above. You'll have a simple, working M-system companion. The rest? Choose your own adventure, learn the documentation by doing. It's much funner that way.
