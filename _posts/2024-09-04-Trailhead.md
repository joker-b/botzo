Just like that, it's Open Studio season again.

This time, _[Sonoma County Art Trails 2024.]({{ site.url}}/trails)_

The main opening reception at the [Sebastopol Center for the Arts](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zDscXChXaA4RwPrA6) is on the 28th of this month, with Open Studio days following in mid/late October, in Petaluma (Studio #145).

But this first _preview_ reception is already upon me, tomorrow evening at _[Corrick's & My Daughter the Framer](http://www.mydaughtertheframer.com/)_ in downtown Santa Rosa.

After weeks of calm, my Epson and web-coding fingers are back to working furiously in preparation for an open studio, here closer to San Francisco. There'll be more details on my _[Art Trails page]({{ site.url}}/trails)_ as the dates approach, in the studio space I hope to show artworks, have some of my portrait gear up (if it's not too busy, maybe even shoot a little), and possibly have my AxiDraw running, plotting some new pen-and-computer-based works there on the spot.

There will be additional preview exhibits around the county in the next few weeks: each will get a piece hinting at different parts of my catalog. Tomorrow's reception gets the pic above from _[Liquidity SF.]({{ site.url}}/liquiditysf/)_

Promotional/schedule postcards have been ordered, and arrive on Monday for me to remail. If you're already on my list, watch your mailbox. If not,

Clicking the button above will send me an email, where you can choose to join the email list or (if you choose to provide an address) the occasional physical mailings.

## Online Ordering

By the date of the "real" showtime, expect to finally see online ordering.

My technical plan has been to connect this and the email newsletter closely to the main botzilla.com site by migrating to the _[Ghost](https://ghost.org/)_ platform from its current form. This simple move has been... a bit complicated.

The current host for botzilla.com doesn't support non-static platforms like Ghost, which dashed my hope to painlessly maintain all the legacy URLs. Instead, they'll be maintained... but painfully (for me). At first I'll be bringing bring up Ghost on a different provider's system, move over the most-important content bit by bit, then thread the DNS needles to invisibly route botzilla.com web traffic to that host, all without hopelessly breaking any of the existing email systems, web analytics, and searches for popular tool pages on this site like Chartthrob or the guide to Contax G focusing (still drawing daily traffic after so many years!).

Painful for me, but hopefully for no one else... and from then on, a smooth steady trail.
