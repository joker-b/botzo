<i>Six rolls of 35mm Tri-X, Xtol 1+1.</i>

I have to admit that I'd been stalling on processing these rolls, dreading them just a little bit. I've grown spoiled by the ease and clarity of digital, and by the tonalities of larger negatives. But I went ahead and ran them and started to slide them into the scanner.

<i>What had I been I thinking?</i> The negs are exactly what I could have hoped for &#151; well-toned, sharp, snappy, clean. Chalk my anxiety up to an infinite fickleness and an easily-suggestible nature.

I keep grasing at a better definition of <i>why,</i> but in the end I still really love the way black and white film looks, and no digital sensor has yet to match its properties, particularly in tonal range (detail and smoothness, yes &#151; and then some). The whole package: light weight, durable cameras, the feel and smell of it with the fixer on your fingers, the latitude and the grain and the direct physicality of it &#151; it still calls to me in a way that newer media, lovely though they may be, have not yet called.

With that in mind I stocked up this morning on a wee bit of Neopan 1600 for <a href="http://neekole.com/" target="nb">Nicole</a> and <a href="http://thegeekout.com/" target="nb">Brandon</a>'s upcoming <a href="http://neekole.com/archives/category/wedding-plans/" target="nb">wedding,</a> in February. <a href="http://blog.geekychick.net/" target="nb">Courtney</a> & I will be shooting photos of the event, I'm starting to work-through the initial various bits of typical logistical planning: when, where, indoor, outdoor, who is who, what kind of ceremony, which relatives need to be seen, staging areas, electrical power, the whole usual list.

The wedding is intended to be "casual, quirky, fun" &#151; I wouldn't expect less. Yet how that translates into photos is open question, so the basic banal issues &#151; intended to reduce the number of undesired surprises &#151; are more or less the same as (or more than) a more traditional wedding (of course I'm not expecting a "give me a #2 with an over-the-shoulder of the bride at the window" sort of session... there are plenty of people around who are <i>much</i> more amenable to that sort of thing. But it's funny how every guest inevitably asks if there are any photos of <it>them</i> with the bride and groom....). The experience will surely help Courtney & I get our own nuptial ducks lined up as well.

I'm still not sure if the event is indoor, outdoor, or mixed &#151; if it's outdoor the Neopan will get swapped-out for some of the HP5+ I've been collecting. It'll <i>all</i> get used in time, regardless.
