I've been using strobe more and more. Outdoors in daylight especially.

Looking at <a href="http://www.brianfinke.com/">Briank Finke's</a> website (thanks <a href="http://www.jmcolberg.com/weblog/">J&ouml;rg</a>) reminds me that with enough strobe anything can look fantastical. The same saturated color can be seen from Martin Parr, for example.

Not just in color, either -- strobe is clear in Diane Arbus, Bruce Gilden, and Jeff Mermelstein.... strobe is like no other light. You <i>can</i> make it look "natural," sure. Should you?

A collision of "what I saw" and "what I made" is at the heart of its charm, no doubt.
