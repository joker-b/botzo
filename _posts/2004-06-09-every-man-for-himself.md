A few years back (okay, a bunch of years back), I attended a session at the <a href="http://www.mnfilmarts.org/" target="_blank">University Film Society,</a> at the Bell Museum on the University of Minnesota campus. Guest for the evening, Werner Herzog, I think to promote <a href="http://www.lesblank.com/more/shoe.html" target="_blank"><i>Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe,</i></a> though that night we watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068182/" target="_blank"><i>Aguirre, the Wrath of God.</i></a>

Afterwards, we went for drinks with Herzog. A hot topic -- the <a href="http://www.brasscheck.com/jonestown/" target="_blank">Jonestown</a> <a href="http://www.rickross.com/groups/jonestown.html" target="_blank">People's Temple</a> mass suicide -- came up in the ocnversation. The Jonestown Massacre. It was still very much in the press. What did Herzog think?

__"I think that's great, 900 fewer assholes in the world."__

<i>Ka-ching!</i> Another one of those bang-on quotes that has resonated for many, many years.

So imagine my surprise when I discover this morning, on <a href="http://www.wernerherzog.com/" target="_blank">Werner Herzog's own site,</a> a little manifesto he calls:

> ## The Minnesota Declaration:
> 
> 1. By dint of declaration the so-called <i>Cinema Verit&eacute;</i> is devoid of <i>verit&eacute;.</i> It reaches a merely superficial truth, the truth of accountants.
> 2. One well-known representative of <i>Cinema Verit&eacute;</i> declared publicly that truth can be easily found by taking a camera and trying to be honest. He resembles the night watchman at the Supreme Court who resents the amount of written law and legal procedures. "For me," he says, "there should be only one single law: the bad guys should go to jail."<br />Unfortunately, he is part right, for most of the many, much of the time.
> 3. <i>Cinema Verit&eacute;</i> confounds fact and truth, and thus plows only stones. And yet, facts sometimes have a strange and bizarre power that makes their inherent truth seem unbelievable.
> 4. Fact creates norms, and truth illumination.
> 5. There are deeper strata of truth in cinema, and there is such a thing as poetic, ecstatic truth. It is mysterious and elusive, and can be reached only through fabrication and imagination and stylization.
> 6. Filmmakers of <i>Cinema Verit&eacute;</i> resemble tourists who take pictures amid ancient ruins of facts.
> 7. Tourism is sin, and travel on foot virtue.
> 8. Each year at springtime scores of people on snowmobiles crash through the melting ice on the lakes of Minnesota and drown. Pressure is mounting on the new governor to pass a protective law. He, the former wrestler and bodyguard, has the only sage answer to this: "You can't legislate stupidity."
> 9. The gauntlet is hereby thrown down.
> 1. The moon is dull. Mother Nature doesn't call, doesn't speak to you, although a glacier eventually farts. And don't you listen to the Song of Life.
> 1. We ought to be grateful that the Universe out there knows no smile.
> 1. Life in the oceans must be sheer hell. A vast, merciless hell of permanent and immediate danger. So much of a hell that during evolution some species - including man - crawled, fled onto some small continents of solid land, where the Lessons of Darkness continue.

My hero.
