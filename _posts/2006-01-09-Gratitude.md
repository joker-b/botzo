<a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/102432">Phil Perkis writes</a> of photography:

<blockquote><i>To experience the meaning of what is. To stay with it for even a few seconds is no small task. The sound of voice without language, a musical line, a ceramic vessel, a non-objective painting. The presence of it, the weight of it, the miracle of its existence, of my existence. The mystery of the fact itself.</i></blockquote>

And <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">Merlin</a> found this comment from <a href="http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/Clubs/buddhism/dailylife/thayq-a.html">Thich Nhat Hanh:</a>

<blockquote><i>When you drive around the city and come to a red light or a stop sign, you can just sit back and make use of these twenty or thirty seconds to relax &#151; to breathe in, breathe out, and enjoy arriving in the present moment. There are many things like that we can do. Years ago I was in Montreal on the way to a retreat, and I noticed that the license plates said </i>Je me souviens<i> &#151; "I remember." I did not know what they wanted to remember, but to me it means that I remember to breathe and to smile.</i></blockquote>

It often seems to me that photography is a daily form of <a href="http://lifeliftcoach.com/content/view/15/32/">gratitude.</a>

Thank you.
