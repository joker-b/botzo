<a href="http://www.photoquotes.com/">Photoquotes</a> has recently put up Berenice Abbott's 1951 essay, <a href="http://www.photoquotes.com/showarticles.aspx?id=8&name=Abbott,Berenice&ArticleID=26">"Photography at the Crossroads."</a> Mentioned twice already <a href="http://www.botzilla.com/blog/archives/000650.html">here on Photorant,</a> it's the same essay reprinted in <a href=""><i>The Education of a Photographer</i></a> (which is now also indexed on Google books).

So you needn't <a href="http://www.botzilla.com/blog/archives/000653.html">take my word for it</a>:

<blockquote><b>"The stale vogue of drowning in technique and ignoring content adds to the pestilence and has become, for many, part of today's general hysteria..."</b></blockquote>
