_Photos from my ongoing "Chinese Sonoma" project will be on display at Santa Rosa's [Finley Center](https://www.srcity.org/2110/Finley-Community-Center) throughout January 2025._

I began making photographs of RECA performances for a dancer in our family. The collection has grown.

In the 1800's, Chinese hands created the first great Sonoma County wineries -- Chinese immigrants were [nearly all of the labor](https://thisdayinwinehistory.com/forgotten-history-of-chinese-immigrants-sonoma/) -- but they built no lasting Chinese settlement. Those early immigrants weren't allowed to own land, and in less than a generation they'd mostly departed. A century later, Chinese families returned, and today three+ generations of modern Chinese Sonomans have built homes, families, connections and careers here -- a community always in motion.

The joys of shared music and dance continue, and have helped this Norwegian American to also feel a part of our ever-richer Sonoman culture.
