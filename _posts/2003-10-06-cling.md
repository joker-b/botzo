<i>Three rolls TMax 100, Xtol 1+1, 9:30 @ 20&#176;C.</i>

This one was shot early on the 10th of September, as we struggled to get ourselves functional before heading to Narita for our long return from Tokyo. About a week later I processed the roll, and the very next night, I ran across a similar shot by Japanese Photoblogger <a title="Samourai photo.: b.Monochrome Archives" href="http://samourai.under.jp/blog/archives/cat_bmonochrome.php#000070">Samourai.</a> Given the time of the post he may have shot his at the very same time, over in Nagoya (I have one even more like his, but I like this one better).

I suppose I could write-up a little diatribe about how everything that <i>can</i> be shot <i>has</i> been shot, and yet how nothing is ever really the same as any other shot, both before and after the moments of exposure. Yeah. I think I'll just leave it as a little shout-out across the Pacific, yo.
