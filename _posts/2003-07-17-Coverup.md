Six rolls of Delta 400, Xtol 1+1@20C, 11.5 mins. Very little PhotoFlo, very short wash, squeegee'd and almost every frame seems dustless. What had I been thinking?</i>

<i>Couple of rolls of Velvia and some 6x6 E100S for good measure.</i>

For the past couple of months now, I've been collecting images for a project that I've not even mentioned in this log. A blog is simply a poor mechanism for working on something large, if the author has a desire to build something wth structure and scope. Imagine a composer posting a few randomly-chosen bars from a musical piece, different each day. Pointless.
