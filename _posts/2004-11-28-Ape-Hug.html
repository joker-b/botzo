<p>When I first started this journal, I did a fair amount of searching for blogs and photoblogs that were involved with wet-darkroom photography, using searches on google amd <a href="http://www.photoblogs.org/profile/botzilla.com/" target="_blank">photoblogs.org</a> for matches to things like <a href="http://www.photoblogs.org/search/?keyword=darkroom" target="apug">darkroom</a> or <a href="http://www.photoblogs.org/search/?keyword=film" target="apug">film</a> <a href="http://www.photoblogs.org/search/?keyword=rangefinder" target="apug">rangefinder</a>. But while there were lots of matches for search terms, as often as not the first post on the found blog would said something like "I've sold off my film-based rangerfinders and darkroom equipment to pay for a D100 so I can post blog pictures every single day..."</p>

<p>So there were very few analog sites (and mostly of the <a href="http://www.dgbn.com/coldmarble/musings.html" target="apug">nostalgic</a> variety), though with some high-profile exceptions like Todd Gross's <a href="http://www.quarlo.com/" target="apug">Quarlo.</a> In the past couple of years they've multiplied, though still not in great numbers. Here are a few found this week, owned by <a href="http://www.apug.org/" target="apug">APUG</a> members (what's wrong with this picture?), a list based on <a href="http://www.apug.org/forums/showthread.php?t=10199" target="apug">this thread</a>:</p>
