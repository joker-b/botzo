It's time again for... <a href="http://www.siggraph.org/s2004/" target="sig">Siggraph!</a> This year Siggraph is in L.A., just a short 50-minute commuter flight from SJC.

Once again this year I'll be speaking at Siggraph, starting on Sunday: I'll be taking the reins from <a href="http://www.siggraph.org/awards/1995/AchievementAward.html" target="sig">Kurt Akeley</a> at 4:35 as a small part of the <a href="http://www.siggraph.org/s2004/conference/courses/1.php?pageID=conference" target="sig">Real Time Shading Course.</a>

On Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday, I'll be lecturing in a sponsored session: <a href="http://developer.nvidia.com/object/nv_at_siggraph_2004.html" target="sig">Transforming Production Workflows with the GPU.</a> As you might have guessed from Chris Maughan's <a href="http://chrismaughan.com/" target="_blank">Jorvik Utopia,</a> I'll be talking a lot about HLSL and interactive tool design and building realtime shaders with <a href="http://www.fxcomposer.com/" target="sig">FX Composer.</a>

In a related note I'll be proctoring <a href="http://www.siggraph.org/s2004/conference/exhibitor/index.php?pageID=conference" target="sig">Microsoft's HLSL Shader Workshops,</a> which occur from Monday through Thursday &#151; not really the lecturer this time, I'll just stand alongside the door with a spear, raise it and shout "Hail, Mighty Caesar!" at the appropriate moments, or prod students along when they have difficulties.

This year I'm bringing along a pedometer. If it's anything like last year, I'll be running up those daily 10,000 steps before lunch time all week.
