Another Spring (C) 2004 K. Bjorke"></a>I just realized, looking at my calendar, that sometime during the month of March, <a href="http://www.botzilla.com/">Botzilla</a> has reached its tenth anniversary!

Sometime in March of 1994, after a decade of junkie-like email usage (ihnp4, baby!), I went onto the infant web with my own site via <a href="http://www.rahul.net/" target="linkframe">rahul.net,</a> listed on the "NCSA Cool Site of the Day" first as "National Pixel Products," and then (as the site grew past software marketing and photo galleries to include tools and pages on my friend <a href="http://www.jbum.com/" target="linkframe" rel="friend">Jim's</a> program <a href="http://www.thepalace.com/" target="linkframe">The Palace</a>), as "Botzilla" and "The House o' Props n Bots."

I can still remember getting that first copy of NCSA Mosaic for my SGI workstation and being told that I could use it to access interesting data "from <i>more than a hundred</i> different sites!"

So belated cheers, <i>o-tanjobi omedeto gozaimasu,</i> and here's hoping that by the time another ten years have passed we aren't stuck with another Bush in the White House, heh.
