The shot here was made with a Leica Monochrom. The lower half: from Adobe's latest "Neural Colorize" filter, which had no trouble at all dealing with the full-res pic. 

I guess I shouldn't have been surprised to see that it also colorized the out-of-focus images on the wall, even though they are actually black and white prints.

I've handed this filter a few difficult cases -- I'm very intrigued at how even on some of the B&amp;W Liquidity photos, it makes an attempt that's not too far from the way they can look if I overprocess and mix color and mono layers. It's not a look I like, but: it is a pretty reasonable attempt at handling a delibereately-unreasonable image.

Nicely done, Adobe!

Back to B&amp;W.
