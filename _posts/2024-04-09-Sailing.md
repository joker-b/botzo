Cherry blossom season: this post is largely written on the 1PM ferry from Tsawassen below Vancouver to Swartz Bay above Victoria. 

This is the week I'm away from my usual computers, studio, and so forth. The previous week, therefore, was a rush of activity much of it expended on finalizing (some) book designs for [_Art at the Source 2024_](https://www.artatthesource.org/).

## Book Designs

I gave myself until Friday and the printer gave me two days less -- three designs were complete enough to send off: _[Forgotten Signs]({{ site.url}}/signs),_ but only the softcover edition; both hard and softcover versions of _[Dancing with No One]({{ site.url}}/dancing);_ and update to _[CHAMPIONS]({{ site.url}}/champions)_ and earlier, an update to _[Sooner or Later Someone Always Gets Hurt.]({{ site.url}}/hurt)_

The works to be completed in the next days are the final hardcover _Forgotten Signs,_ which is easy, and the very difficult and complex foldable design for _Market Hours._

Still to come if I dare to risk limiting proofs: _Wisdom of the Elders,_ and the newer projects I'm calling _Cryptotheology_ and one I'm just calling _The Bear Project._ 

It struck me, thanks to comments from [See See](https://seeseelo.com) and designer Eddie Lee, that I might benefit from getting some of these titles in front of the attendees of the Sonoma Valley Authors Festival -- even a shorter deadline, it begins on the 26th of this month! 

With that in mind, the most I can hope to complete is a postcard with some titles, cover art, a QR code back to the website and an option for pre-orders. This is still a whole suite of quick-burn efforts: getting the selections, designing the card (in InDesign or Affinity Publisher -- I have dummies for both), getting it turned around by the 25th (Vistaprint, most likely), and distributed somehow to places around the Author's Festival.

## Web Design

The card also needs _another_ QR code to track those specific visitors (to let myself know if this worked at all), and -- the biggest lift -- a move to the entire website that will allow subscriptions and online pre-ordering.

At this moment, this looks like a move from the current Jekyll web platform to one like Ghost is the most flexible and quickest. The shift might be in stages, with essential content moved to Ghost before switching the DNS entries, verifying email services, then trickling-in all the missing articles one by one once the most-important URLs -- key articles that get more traffic, AATS and book links, Chartthrob and other tools -- are sure to be working.

## New Artwork

The size limits for the Art at the Source gallery show and reception are 1000 squre inches -- _seems_ like a lot -- enough for a 24x36 inch print -- I'm thinking that I might build an entirely new piece just for the gallery, rather than some "greatest hit" from the archives. Something that will be more than "representative" and will work to bring people into the open studio gallery too. More on this plan soon. The artwork needs to be ready by the 7th of May and related works (that connect it to the studio) would only have another week or two.

## Printing

Photo printing, matting and bagging will need to go into production mode after the 14th or 15th. My current estimates are for around 100 new prints. At four good ones per day that's a month of printing, so I do need to raise my output rate.

## AatS Bureaucracy

Bits and bobs: the AatS catalog has been proofed -- and changes requested. Their website: changes requested. Festivals and farmer's markets: upcoming. It's a lot of work for them, especially given the addition of more artists from new parts of the county for 2024. Those paper catalogs should start appearing in venues around the bay around the same time as the Author's Festival.

See you at Studio 16B on June 1st.
