<i>One roll TMax 100, 8min + a little more in Xtol 1::1 at 22C</i>

Shot a lot from the passenger seat of Courtney's car today. Lots of ideas about the banality and almost ritual sameness of the actions of each passing motorist.

Dang it, out of TMax after the next roll.

Checking the catalog, I realize that the <a href="http://www.library.ci.santa-clara.ca.us/" target="linkframe">local library</a> has <i>one</i> <a href="http://www.uta.edu/english/apt/collab/baudweb.html" target="linkframe">Jean Baudrillard</a> title <i>(America),</i> and 252 titles matching "Star Trek."
