<i>I think that I shall never see<br>
A number lovelier than three.</i>

Some examples:

_We Try Harder: Part Three_

One of the &#151; ahem &#151; features of longer air travel is
that you get to see a lot of movies on the inflight screens that
you otherwise might have successfully avoided. One of these
movies, in the past couple of weeks, was <i>Terminator 3:
Rise of the Machines.</i>

<!--more-->

<i>Terminator 3</i> seems to be one of those films that was
years and years in the making &#151; that is, years and years of
negotiations over when, who, and how much they would all be paid.
And as afterthoughts, maybe we'll need a script. <i>T3</i> is a
film completely devoid of significant surprise, just a long
parade of fairly stock action sequences, set against expensively
comptetent but uninspired effects. I watched it first with the
sound off, then as it repeated on our long transatlantic leg, I
saw it again with the sound enabled, hoping it would somehow make
more sense and improve. Nope.

I won't go in depth into the many awkward gaffs and holes in
the plot &#151; most noticeably to me, how the protagonists
casually walk into a supposedly-guarded military complex carrying
heavy weapons, much less how they wander into a hardened,
well-stocked military bomb shelter that's both unguarded and
abandoned (though filled with equipment that looks recently-used,
and with a computerized security system). The "plot" was just a
thin premise for lurching between More Of The Same set
pieces, essentially a film built from commercials for the
previous film.

One could say that <i>Matrix Revolutions</i> suffered from the
same disease, and to a degree it probably did (the scenes with
the Merovingian are an obvious example). And I really don't
think I can imagine a film that's more full of itself than this
third <i>Matrix,</i> even including the second one, which I
usually refer to as <i>Burning Man versus Microsoft
Corporation.</i>

Both of these Part Three movies suffer from the weight of their
predecessors as Brand Names. When Cameron made <i>T2</i> twelve
years ago, he was willing to vividly re-imagine the base material
(as he did with <i>Aliens</i>), and sew it together in a way that
paid off his quietly thoughtful art-school ending. <i>T3</i> is
just an exercise in posing, and to a degree so is
<i>Revolutions.</i>

Having done some work on <i>Animatrix,</i> I had seen boards
for most of the effect for both <i>Matrix</i> sequels quite a
long time ago. They immediately bothered me for two reasons. I
hoped that the Wachowskis, who had been so clever in the first
<i>Matrix,</i> would find some way through these two hazards. By
the time <i>Matrix Reloaded</i> appeared in theatres this summer,
I knew that my hopes were in vain.

The first problem, one shared by many sequels (<i>2010</i>
comes readily to mind), is that filmmakers (and audiences) often
forget that films aren't real. By that I mean, films are often
constructed in a metaphoric way, that their environments and
story elements are not reconstructions of some "real"
circumstance, but they are instead deliberately shaped and
stylized for the sake of making a point. When a sequel comes
along, how are to deal with these distorted circumstances?

The first <i>Matrix</i> uses its environment to make
metaphoric statements about society and an ordered existence
&#151; not the fantasy-world existence of the Matrix, but of
<i>our</i> existence. When Neo sees past the illusory nature of
his social context, he is free to be anything &#151; the last
"Superman" shot is there to emphasize and symbolize his newfound
mental freedom.

For the sequels, they're stuck trying to explain Superman. The
key metaphysical point of the entire <i>Matrix</i> enterprise has
already been made, and they have nothing more to say beyond it
&#151; instead, they're left worrying about the mechanics, trying
(with increasingly-expensive and silly effects) to make us
believe in the "reality" of the Matrix, <i>exactly opposite
to the point of the first movie.</i>

(Similarly, <i>2010</i> frets through similar metaphoric
territory, trying to take the final "ultimate trip" sequence of
<i>2001</i> at representational face value. What the heck was
the director thinking?)

The second hazard for <i>Revolutions,</i> perhaps caused by
desperation over the first issue, is that they Broke The
Spell.

Neo has superman powers in the Matrix because it <i>is</i> the
Matrix. The Matrix, as a rational bit of engineering, is
preposterous. But we the audience accept it, in the best
science-fiction tradition, because it is a compelling metaphor.
And all of the subsequent action, however outrageous, can be
accepted from that perspective. The audience can accept
<i>one</i> magical notion, and from that basis the rest of the
movie can make consistent sense.

But at the end of <i>Reloaded,</i> and throughout
<i>Revolutions,</i> they Break the Spell. Neo, <i>outside</i> the
Matrix, lifts up his arm and by waving a Vulcan gang sign at
sentinel robots, collapses them into a heap. At this point, all
possible hope for dramatic interest has left the room.

Once you have a story that's perceived as <i>magical,</i> you
can just forget about causality in the mind of the audience
(indeed, discarding causality is essentially what magic's all
about). By the time we get to <i>Revolutions,</i> Neo's robot
hand signals aren't just shutting down robots, he's exploding
them by the hundreds.

And once causality goes away, then so too does any hope of
finding any sort of satisfactory ending to the story. In most
satisfying film endings, the end comes as a direct understandable
consequence of the actions of the characters &#151; though
usually in some unexpected way. Not so, once character causality
has disappeared. Instead, special effects simply start erupting
out of things randomly, Agent Smith gets eaten by unexplained
light beams, the dead body of Neo is ported off into a glowing
electronic vagina, and the marginal characters, added only for
the sake of the sequels and their lifeless plot mechanics, stride
off into a cheerfully multicolored sunset reminiscent of a Lisa Frank
catalog.

As a counterpoint to <i>Terminator,</i> United Air was also
playing <i>Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle.</i> No surprise that
the director, "McG," spent his days churning out MTV spots before
the <i>Angels</i> movies &#151; <i>Full Throttle</i> is just a
chain of music-vid-like set pieces. The plot is even less
substantive than in <i>Terminator</i> or <i>Revolutions,</i> but
one dosen't really expect the three Angels to be involved in any
sort of drama or genuine predicament. The action is so over the
top, TV commercial characterizations and candy cane sexuality, that there's no
need to worry about story. Just a loopy chain of explosions, car
crashes, and musical numbers. Entertainingly harmless when
watched on a TV or a 5-inch airline-seat screen, though I can
easily imagine the experience being claustrophobic in a darkened
theatre.

<i>Full Throttle</i> also has Bernie Mac, an actor whose screen
persona so often seems to be out of control, though I suspect that
in person he's as measured and exacting in his work as a jeweler.

Bernie Mac deadpans his way beautifully through a supporting
role in the winning movie of recent weeks, <i>Bad Santa.</i>
There's more genuine astonishment and entertainment value in the first
three minutes of <i>Bad Santa</i> than in the previous three
films combined.
