<a href="/photo/journal/snowed.html"><img src="http://www.botzilla.com/bpix/snowed.jpg" width=400 height=267 border=0 hspace=8 vspace=6 align="right" title=""></a>So I've almost finished selling my <a href="/blog/archives/000269.html">Canon SLR gear,</a> to pay for my... Canon SLR gear. That is, the old-school manual-focus SLR gear to pay for... well, old-school manual-focus SLR gear, in the guise of old-style AE/MM <a href="http://www.contaxcameras.com/home/history.html" target="linkframe">Zeiss</a> <a href="http://www.contaximages.com" target="linkframe">Contax</a> lenses mounted on a digital Canon EOS. Monday I was lucky enough to snag a <i>new</i> 28 &#131;/2.8 for less than the price of a nice used one, by following up on someone else's Ebay transaction gone wrong. Hurrah.

I've noticed in practice that I much prefer using manual focus with my EOS 300D, despite so many earnest users telling me that it's a bad idea, that the screen is hard to focus on, the AF is terrific, etc etc. The only thing lacking, really, has been manual-focus lenses that are <i>built</i> to be focused manually, with a longer throw on the barrel for exacting manual control, combined with a hardy, solid feel (Canon's 50mm &#131;/1.8 Mk II is a lens that, while inexpensive, is built to <a href="http://www.seittipaja.fi/data/Pontification/b_Photography/g_Fifty_versus_fifty/a_Fifty_versus_fifty.html">keep margins low</a> &#151; in other words, it's lightly built, and the front elements wander). The <a href="http://www.techphoto.org/urllinks.epl?webobjectoid=21199" target="linkframe">Zeiss,</a> built for cameras like the Aria and <a href="http://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/hardwares/classics/contax/contaxrts/index.htm" target="linkframe">pro-level</a> <a href="http://www.cdegroot.com/photo/contax/rts/" target="linkframe">RTS,</a> has <a href="http://www.photo.net/contax/shea-lenses" target="linkframe">that solid feel</a> in spades.

Even better luck, I hope, on the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ilprode/TestZ.htm" target="linkframe">50mm &#131;/1.4,</a> a lens that's sharper than either Canon version and yet cheaper due to the small demand from <a href="http://www.contax.ch/" target="linkframe">Contax shooters.</a> Used ones usually run $150 to $200. On a hunch, a few days ago I started looking to see if I could get a better deal by simply buying an old Aria or 167MT, with a 50mm attached &#151; lucky me, I found a 50 for a low-end price, complete with an attached <a href="http://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/hardwares/classics/contax/" target="linkframe" title="the camera I'd always wanted to afford back when I bought my manual Canons">RTS!</a> If it's at all in good shape (particularly the shutter, which is impossible to service these days) I should be able to turn the body alone around for nearly the cost of the lens. Or consider it a free camera :)

On the subject of how few <a href="http://www.contaxinfo.com/" target="linkframe">Contax users</a> there are &#151; 'twas ever thus, even in the beginning days of the Japanese Contaxes. A tragedy, really. It's not easy to find much about them on the web, either &#151; which is why I tried to pile as many links as possible into this entry. My friend <a href="http://www.skjaerven.com" target="linkframe">Knut,</a> while tossing back Tuborgs a couple of months back, opined that he was the only Contax user he knew of in Denmark.
