Why this is major news is beyond me, but <a title="CNN.com - They're back: 'V' to invade NBC again - Jun. 9, 2003" href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/TV/06/09/television.visitors.reut/index.html">CNN</a> is reporting via Reuters that the old TV series <cite>V</cite> is in for a remake. Ungh. One supposes they will say that Osama is a lizard now, or some similarly-pandering "deep" metaphor. Big deal?

What's annoying to me is that a search of the web <i>still</i> doesn't show just how much of the original pilot mini was straight-lifted from Bertolt Brecht's little-seen play <a href="http://www.questors.org.uk/questopics/485/fmisery.html"><cite>The Private Life of the Master Race</cite></a> (aka <cite>Fear and Misery of the Third Reich</cite>)

A few years back I was rabidly attacked by a certain Warner Bros' producer for saying this in an online forum, an ongoing barrage of threatening emails until I finally had to contact Brecht's estate. How dare I impugn the literary majesty of the author of <cite>V,</cite> who had already said that he was inspired by Sinclair Lewis, not some foreign-refugee upstart?

Still today, one is hard-pressed to find the names "Kenneth Johnson" and "Brecht" on the same web search, save on <a href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006GJ90/ref%3Dpd%5Fecs%5Fd%5Fv%5Fa/302-0941814-9623222">Amazon.com's <i>German</i> site</a> (where the audience is far more likely to have ever heard of <cite>Furcht und Elend im Dritten Reich</cite>). But not here in the good ol' US of A, no sir. We only credit lifts from Amurrican writers 'round here.
