<i>Third St Almost to Minna</i>

It's been a while since I've written about the web tech of botzilla or random photo gear issues. No time like the present.



First off I've been slowly updating all of botzilla to use more modern web frameworks, which happily work well with the ratchety old Moveable Type backend. The blog portions were easy to complete, the older <a href="/photo/g1links.html">Powershot</a> & <a href="/photo/salon/gindex.html">Streetphoto archive</a> bits will come soon enough. I'm also rearranging some of the tag bins, mostly to reflect the changes in botzilla intent since the original charter.

Given the general growth of the blogosphere since botzilla's early day, I doubt that anyone other than myself will really notices these changes.

On the camera front, my <a href="archives/cat_canon.html">Canons</a> are being retired, along with my TLRs and Bronica rangefinder (one TLR, the Bronica, a 5D body and a couple of lenses are still for sale!). I initially intended to replace them with the latest <a href="archives/cat_leicasonic.html">Leicasonic LX (LX-7)</a> and later a <a href="archives/cat_fujifilm.html">Fuji X100s&hellip;</a> to my surprise the littler of these little cameras was dominant for a while, though over time and practice I've come to use the X100s more and more, eventually supplanting it with an X-T1 which is terrific and provdes a second career for my <a href="archives/cat_contax.html">Contax</a> lenses, but the X100s is still doing the bulk of my shooting as of September 2014.

Like everyone, I'm also shooting a lot with my phone, occasionally with a tablet, and intermittently with Google Glass. More entries to come on all of these technologies as I stumbled along ahead.
