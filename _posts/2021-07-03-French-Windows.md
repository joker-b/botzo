At the end of 2019 we wandered a few weeks through France: visiting old neighborhoods and new, old friends and new. We had no clue that it might be years before American visitors will be allowed to return.

The expected photos from such a trip I'd seen -- and made -- before. This time, a project, and a tip of the karmic chapeau to Ralph Gibson, whose book _L'Histoire De France,_ as I recall, was his first color publication.

_La r√®gle du jeu:_

* Use only the 50mm "normal" perspective.
* Use only the "portrait" vertical format.
* Focus always to exactly one meter.

The results can be seen <a href="https://www.blurb.com/bookstore/invited/9247631/2b8eb21302616eabb8083ac1d7822724b8b74ada">here</a> -- and if you like them and/or would like to support PhotoRant -- then by all means, feel free to 
<a href="https://www.blurb.com/bookstore/invited/9247631/2b8eb21302616eabb8083ac1d7822724b8b74ada">buy the book!</a>

ISBN 9781006763564: It's almost like visiting Provence.
