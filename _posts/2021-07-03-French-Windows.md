At the end of 2019 we wandered a few weeks through France: visiting old neighborhoods and new. Old friends and new, as well.

The expected photos from such a trip I'd seen -- and made -- before. This time, a project, and a tip of the karmic chapeau to Ralph Gibson, whose book _L'Histoire De France_ was I think his first color publication.

_La r√®gle du jeu:_

* Use only the 50mm "normal" perspective.
* Use only the "portrait" vertical format.
* Focus always to exactly one meter.

The results can be seen <a href="https://www.blurb.com/books/10618096-french-windows">here</a> -- and if you like them and/or would like to support PhotoRant -- then by all means, feel free to 
<a href="https://www.blurb.com/b/10618096-french-windows">buy the book!</a>

ISBN 9781034551362: It's almost like visiting Provence.
