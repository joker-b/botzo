Spent most of the day running back and forth through the rain to see as much of <a href="http://www.contactphoto.org/">Contact Photo</a> as the rain would allow, and last night chasing around the Lanch Event. Tomorrow I'll hit the MOCCA portion before returning home. Fell asleep -- coffee in hand -- just as the early-evening weather outside my hotel room was surging past the drizzly form shown here into a real driving storm.

I also had the pleasure during the morning of driving across town to visit the <a href="http://www.elevatorworkshops.com/carnie.shtml">Bob Carnie</a> & <a href="http://www.creativeshake.com/profile.html?MyUrl=kevinviner">Kevin Viner</a> at <a href="http://www.elevatordigital.ca">Elevator Digital,</a> where I got to see their big print line including their digital fiber-print mural-scale line, which they believe was the world's first. These are large-format images, printed on black & white traditional darkroom paper -- a good deal bgger than what the well-known Devere digital enlarger can produce.

I also got a glimpse at the results from the Canon imagePROGRAF iPF9100 60" printer, which delivered gorgeous B&W results straight our of the bx -- that is, on the supplied Canon profiles without tweaking.

To my surprise, when I awoke two hours after dozing away, the view was dazzlingly different: the towers lit by an orange sunset and framed by a deep blue sky. Surprising what a couple of hours can do if you'll just willing to stay put (sleeping helps).

<i>What about the photographs?</i> I'll write more about them in the next entry.
