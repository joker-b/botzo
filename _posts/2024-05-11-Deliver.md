## Three Weeks to Go in the Fuzzy Front End

<center>

Today is the official gallery reception at [Sebastopol Center for the Arts](https://sebart.org).

This isn't the first: last Saturday there was also a preview reception at [Gallery One in Petaluma.](https://petaluma-galleryone.com/) Instead of a hard start, there's a fuzzy front end to the schedule [AatS]({{ site.url}}/aats), composed of mixed deadlines and promotion sub-events.

More on both receptions (and other events) below:

These posts tend to emphasize marketing and promotion over the creation of original work. Yet they are always integrated: it collecting photos from my "Humdingers" project, and thinking more deeply about their presentation and _"who are these for?"_ the selection process is clearer, the ordering more sensible, and in at least this case, the title has changed, to [_Grafitti Generations._]({{ site.url}}/generations)

The timing is less-than-stellar, I realize: the annual ["Salute to American Grafitti" event](https://americangraffiti.net/) is next weekend and it's very very unlikely that I'll have books on-hand to sample. The reality of a busy summer.

However, I've started getting nibbles on the "Click here to get updates" buttons so I know there is an audience for this book, these photos.

Slightly related, another summer-photography tentpole for me is Santa Rosa's [Peggy Sue Cruise.](https://www.cruiseforpeggysue.com/) It occurs on the final Saturday of Art at the Source, so on June 8th I'll be quick to close-up shop and roar over mid-event. The cover shot of _Grafitti Generations_ was made during that event. 

### Preview Reception

For the single small print shown at the Gallery One preview, I'd planned to use a very easy-to-look-at one from [_The Caged Bouquet_]({{ site.url}}/cage) but as delivery day approached I realized that alone, it's just too much a "pretty person looking pretty" which was not at all the point of the project nor of my broader photo-making.

Instead the same dancer is present in the background of a different selection with other cast members of the Ballet Naci√≥nal de Cuba's production of _Giselle,_ along with interesting backlight, catholicism, memories, anticipation and motion. As someone who cares about narrative-like relationships within and between images, it's better.

I know some advisors may feel differently: more people might like the first one better in isolation, but pleasing everyone with candy is not the goal. There's no shortage of those kind of photos, I don't need to contribute there.

## Web Changes & Technicalities

[See See]({{ site.url}}/seeseelo) pointed out some problems with the existing [Jekyll "collections" method](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/) for organizing images -- it jumbled-up on some versions of the Safari browser. Fixed it, and one I did, applied it to [the book page]({{ site.url}}/book24) too.

This new edition of collections not only works correctly on iPhone and iPad, it also adds a `rank` option so that you can re-order the collection any way you want, not just by title or date.

## Book Designs

The hardcover edition of _[Forgotten Signs]({{ site.url}}/signs)_ has arrived, looks good. The printer didn't offer a paper wrap half-cover, so I still have to design and print one -- having the physical books will make it straightforward. I hope.

As mentioned above, [_Grafitti Generations_]({{ site.url}}/generations) is in-flight, due back from teh printer _just a bit late_ for the annual _Grafitti_-themed event. Looking on the bright side, maybe more people will drive to Sebastopol.

_Minor Chaos:_ I very nearly forgot to order the books after the test prints! Fortunately I did a check of the stock in time or I'd have four copies.

## Card Designs - the Other Kind

The _[RBF]({{ site.url}}/rbf)_ note cards have arrived, and look good.

A second set of art cards, with the working title of "Joker B's" should also be ready before the studio days.

## New Artwork for the SebArts Gallery

Arrived, delivered!

As I was leaving the gallery someone trotted out from the back to catch me: "that piece is really neat!"

Hope you visit the gallery and agree!




_See you at [Studio 16B]({{ site.url}}/aats) on June 1st._
