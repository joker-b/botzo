John Bolgiano, aka "coldmarble," runs <a title="ColdMarble Musings" href="http://www.dgbn.com/coldmarble/musings.html">ColdMarble Musings,</a>the only <a href="http://www.alternativephotography.com/" target="linkframe">alternative-process</a> (Cyanotype, Van Dyke process, etc) blog I've seen &#151; so far. Looks like <a href="http://www.geekychick.net/" target="linkframe">Courtney</a> might give him <a href="http://www.newdags.com/" target="linkframe">some competition</a> soon.

She checked-out Reed & Webb's <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/product/216028/SAAPP/REG/1052" target="link frame">Alternative Photographic Processes</a> from the library yesterday, prepping for an alt-process class, and noticed that it was completely untouched &#151; never checked-out before, the book's binding crackling as she turned each page.

We've noticed similar behavior on some other library photo books recently &#151; she acquired a stack of beautiful <a href="http://www.martinparr.com" target="linkframe">Martin Parr</a> books via loan from a library in San Diego, and their stamps showed they'd not been checked out for years. Tsk!
