This weekend! The 2025 edition of _[Salute to American Graffiti](https://www.americangraffiti.net/)_ and the first time that _[Graffiti Generations]({{ site.url }}/generations)_ is available not only from me directly, but also at the [Petaluma Arts Center](https://www.petalumaartscenter.org/) and also [online.](https://www.magcloud.com/browse/issue/2824167?__r=97979)

Meanwhile, I've started right in on new photos of the 2025 show, beginning today with a parking lot cruise-in.

For the past couple of weeks the low rumble of big idling motors has been heard in the neighborhood -- people checking to see if their old cars will still run this year. A few of those cars have been circling the block verrry slowly, just to be certain. Even if they can't get it out of second gear.

A few of those cars can barely make it to the parking lot, and won't be in the annual cruise parade. It's okay. The event has something for everyone -- even, this year, an all-electric vehicle built by the local HS auto-shop team.
