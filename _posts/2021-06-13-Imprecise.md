For the previous post, I had to dig out some of my old files from a brief 2014 affair with the original Leica Monochrom.

This one was shot on the streets of Miami. The artist here told me he was from elsewhere but I can't recall his name or those details any more. Or maybe I'm just being misguided by the tee-shirt.

Photos can trick memory as much as assist it.
