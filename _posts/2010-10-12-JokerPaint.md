Speaking of painting and computers, I've been working off and on on "JokerPaint," a little let's-beat-images-senseless sort of toy made using <a href="http://www.processing.org">Processing</a> and with a lot of the heavy pixel lifting being done via chains of filters that I've made using the GLSL framework in Andr&eacute;s Colubri's <a href="http://codeanticode.wordpress.com/2010/08/22/glgraphics-0-9-4/">GLGraphics library.</a> I expect that at some point I'll post it to <a href="http://www.openprocessing.org/">OpenProcessing.</a>

The image above was generated from the photo in <a href="http://www.botzilla.com/blog/archives/000714.html">this recent post.</a> Unlike most paint-like image processes, JokerPaint's imaging is continuous and real-time -- never static. It's constantly revising and touching-up and I just picked a frame at random for this still picture.
