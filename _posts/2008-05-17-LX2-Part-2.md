As I expected, I've gotten more used to the <a href="http://www.botzilla.com/blog/archives/000642.html">LX2.</a>

In the clich&eacute;d and time-honored tradition of pointing Leicas at brick walls to prove that their lenses are top-notch, here's a closer sample of an in-camera-sepia JPEG. The right-hand area shows a detail from the picture on the left -- pixels at one-to-one size (if anything, the image here is degraded just because it's a web-compressed pic. It was also hand-held).

As long as I'm willing to put my thumb on the monitor, it's fine in the hand. During the past week I've been shooting with it at the <a href="http://www.ionconference.com/">ION Conference,</a> using it as a notepad to keep track of presentation slides. In the hand for an hour at a time and I've gotten used to the idea. No hand strain. In JPEG, it's also plenty fast.

Tomorrow I'm taking Gary's advice and trying a much faster SD card for shooting in RAW mode. If it can get the differentials indicated on <a href="http://www.robgalbraith.com/bins/multi_page.asp?cid=6007">Rob Galbraith's</a> benchmark site, there might be as much as a 4x acceleration, which will keep me quite happy (even a modest improvement might be enough).
