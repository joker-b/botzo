It's winter: time to work on the summer crops. I'm participating in this June's Sonoma-wide [_Art at the Source 2024_](https://www.artatthesource.org/), and will be documenting the many changes required to my projects, printing process, book-making, billing, website, advertising, etc. that are needed for that event.

Depending on the results, consider it either a how-to or how-not-to series.

<!--more-->

I'm doing this work in concert with other Sonoma artists, most-notably [See See](https://seeseelo.com) but also my studio sponsor [Barbara Harris,](https://www.instagram.com/barbaraharris_designs/) who will be providing studio display space in Sebastopol -- there will also be a salon show at the [Sebastopol Center for the Arts](https://www.sebarts.org/), just a few blocks away from that dedicated display.

Here are some of the tasks required over the next three months that I'll be writing-up in more as-it-happens detail:

* Tax Registry with the County and State (already done)
* Placement and posting in the show catalog
* Creating a small number of images to fill-out some projects
* Creating New-for-the-show work
* Budgets and more-detailed budgets
* Designing and test-printing and production printing of several small series as books
* Creating and packaging editioned prints to go with those series projects
* Building-out my own toolkit for the art-fair format: physical and legal
* Promoting to specific audiences
* Tracking visitors to Botzilla from both the show catalog and the show
* Updating botzilla.com to enable a regular email newsletter, and also integration to a sales system

Early days! See you at Studio 16B on June 1st.
