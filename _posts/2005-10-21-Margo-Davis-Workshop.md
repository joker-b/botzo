This  past weekend was the <a href="http://inquirer.stanford.edu/Fall2004/knchase/Margo.html">Margo Davis</a>  "Photographing People" workshop, offered through UC Santa Cruz and given nearby in Palo Alto. This was actually the first sort of photo <i>class</i> I've taken since my brief distribution semester back at CalArts...

Margo is a well-known B&W portraitist and creator of the recent book and gallery show <a href="http://www.throckmorton-nyc.com/Exhibitions/MargoDavis/MargoDavis_index.htm"><cite>Under One Sky.</cite></a> The course brought in students of varying interests, levels of experience, and backgrounds; and she was great at being inclusive and attentive to all.

Margo is small and very kinetic &#151; watching her work with another student as a subject, and then in her suggestions to my own shooting, I came to appreciate how that same (inate?) kinesthetic and spatial sense  could be (and was) reflected in her way of posing subjects, moving the camera, etc.

I was happy with the experience because I learned a lot of things that I wasn't really expecting to learn from really everyone there, including the formal characteristics of what Margo describes as "edge of the forest" lighting, which is what I used for the portrait at right, of activist and co-student John Erhart.

I'll try to post some other photos from the workshop to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">flickr</a> in coming days, under the shared tag <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/margodavis/">margo_davis.</a>
