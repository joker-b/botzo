The Washoe House up the road has been open since 1859, making it possibly America's oldest continuously-operating tavern.

After the assassination of President Lincoln, angry militamen from Petaluma California rode out to invade the town of Santa Rosa and to burn down an anti-Unionist newspaper. Opponents got as far as Roblar Road, where "The Battle of Washoe House" ended in war-weary drinks rather than violence.
