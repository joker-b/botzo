<p>After a four-month fling with Neopan 400 Presto (aka Neopan Professional), as of this batch I'm back to Ilford Delta. The Fuji is great stuff, easily pushed, crisp, contrasty. I picked some up in a corner store in <a href="../photo/T2002/">Tokyo,</a> having run out of Ilford. I was delighted with the results, but Delta has a smooth tone and latitude that I've grown used to. And I can actually find it bulkrolled in the store.</p>

<p>I ran the Fuji through a battery of tests &#151; to ISO 200, pushed to 800, 1600, 3200. Xtol, Rodinal. For web purposes, running it at 800 was perfectly fine &#151; for reasonably-sized printing. Good for an overcast winter. The last dozen rolls were all shot that way.</p>

<p>In going back to Delta I've realized that I hadn't done any methodical examination on it since first shooting the old version, almost a decade ago. So it's overdue! Hopefully over the next few days I can run a few rolls for the sake of the same tests &#151; do some more-formal comparisons on Tmax 100 too (Acros is <i>really</i> great but hard to find around here and <i>never</i> in bulk). <a href="http://www.contaximages.com/user.php?id=2">Rich</a> has said he'd like to go out shooting in Marin sometime soon... hmm</p>

<p>Two rolls of unprocessed Neopan still sitting in the "need to process" box. One marked "Jan03K." Tsk.</p>
