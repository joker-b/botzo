Almost time to say goodbye to China, now that I'm back in Beijing. Also time to say goodbye to:
* My Canon 50mm f/1.4, which spontaneously has decided it doesn't want to focus on anything closer than 5 feet, even in manual (at least until I can send it off to Canon)
* My Panasonic LX1, which was pick-pocketed in Xi'an (along with most of my pix of the Xi'an city walls and street musicians)
* My HTC Excalibur smartphone, with all my notes and action items from the entire trip (pick-pocketed just tonight inside the Hyatt)
* My faith in Cisco VPN (pretty-well worthless on this trip)

So that's maybe $1000 in theft losses and a major dose of work frustration. Net balance for the trip then? _Love it._ Hassles and troubles like those just transform a vacation into an adventure, and the experiences I've had will last a lifetime, unlike any sort of electronic gizmo (and I have paper backups of my notes).

If  I can just keep my laptop and 5D working for two more days....

(Follow-up: I remind myself, a bit, of my old second (third) cousin who raced motorcycles and cars and kept soldiering on through the many hospitalizations as just part of the passion....)

Which doesn't begin to compare to <a href="http://2point8.whileseated.org/2008/01/07/robbed/">what happened to Michael</a> :(
