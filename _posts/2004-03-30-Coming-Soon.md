Bjorke"></a>Yes, another <a href="/photo/salon/gindex.html">Street Photography Salon</a> day has come and gone. My entries were admittedly a bit rushed as I've been slamming my schedule for the past couple of weeks, in preparation for my <a href="http://developer.nvidia.com/object/gdc_2004_presentations.html" target="linkframe">presentations at the 2004 Game Developer's Conference,</a> which has also now come and gone over the past few days.

Our newest computer imaging book, <a href="http://developer.nvidia.com/object/gpu_gems_home.html" target="linkframe"><i>GPU Gems,</i></a> came out Monday and was an instant hit within the computer world &#151; the guy running the GDC bookstore said its sales far outstripped any other title (including other new ones), by a factor of five or more (the link, BTW, includes an <a href="http://developer.nvidia.com/docs/IO/11801/Chapter_3.pdf" target="linkframe">example chapter</a> partly written by yhc). Rebecca and Isaac are now (in their words) "famous" since the book also contains a couple of my photos, in which they appear.

So now there's a bit more breathing space, at least for a couple of weeks before embarking on our next journey (to Florida and the Bahamas for some long-overdue vacation time) &#151; allowing, among other things, for a little time to spend on The Blog.
