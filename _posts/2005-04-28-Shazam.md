<i>Three 35mm rolls of Neopan 1600, three rolls of HP5+, all in Xtol 1+1.</i>

As the saying goes, you're never quite so fully aware as in the first  second after the hammer comes down on your thumb.

Which is a bit like how I felt a couple of nights ago as I poured out the fixer on these rolls and saw scraps of paper and hair swirling in the wash water. I rinsed &#151; still bits of paper. Rinsed again &#151; more bits. The paper chunks and fibers seemed to be from some residual torn tape from a roll of 120 processed earlier. I rinsed and washed the reels, the tanks, ran another set.

<i>More scraps and hair.</i>It was in the stop bath! And in the fixer. So last night it was a big flush &#151; throw out all the stored chemistry, rinse the storage bottles, tear apart every reel and scrub it with a toothbrush.

Funny thing is, the rolls that were processed in the fuzzy solution: <i>nearly perfect.</i> Not a scratch, not a hair, not tiny specks needing spotting. <i>Shazam.</i>
