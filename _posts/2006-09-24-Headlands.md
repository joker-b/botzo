This was the first day I really started feeling comfortable with the 5D &#151; the first day I really got to use it uninterupted for more than three minutes, heh. Some may think I'm being stodgy but I've decided to attempt, whenever possible, to use manual exposure. This after years and years of AE.

I'm also delighted to be able to get a <a href="/blog/archives/000378.html">proper AF lock</a> via <a href="http://photography-on-the.net/forum/showthread.php?t=46965">CFn4-1,</a> just like my film EOS (but unlike the 300D). It is a beautiful, beautiful thing.
