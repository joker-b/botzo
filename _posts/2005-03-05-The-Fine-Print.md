It's always in the details. This weekend finds me printing and reprinting comparison pix, looking at differences between methods: between digital and medium format film cameras, and between different ways to print their results.

Since the beginning of the year I've found myself increasingly dissatisfied with prints smaller than 8&#215;10", printing 11&#215;14 and preferably larger. The Epson will deliver a predictable solid 12x18 from 35mm format digi, or 12x12 from a MF negative. And even that seems small a lot of the time...

Part of this inclination toward ever-larger paper came from printing the extended-family photos made at Christmas. I could print the faces at nearly life-sized, and was terribly excited by their immediacy. That immediacy, of the image and the object of the paper itself, is not something that can be carried on a smaller print or a book, much less on a web page. <a href="http://www.calypsoinc.com/">Calypso</a> will make me prints even larger, for a price (a pretty reasonable one). Thursday I was looking over some of their B&amp;W Lightjet output, and they've done a fine job at getting tones out of both the low and high ends of the scale.

Last night Rebecca & I visited an <a href="http://www.modernbook.com/2x20.htm">opening reception at Modernbook</a> in Palo Alto, mostly to see <a href="http://pages.sbcglobal.net/b-evans/show/">Brad Evans</a> and his prints (Brad also introduced us to <a href="http://www.spirer.com/">Jeff Spirer,</a> who has a show in SF in the coming few weeks). At least one of the artists in the group, <a href="http://www.davidhibbard.com/">David Hibbard,</a> had printed most all of his work at Calypso.

The gallery also had, in the upsatirs area, some <a href="http://monakuhn.com/">Mona Kuhn</a> prints (annoyingly, I missed her show there, which was hung while I was out of town). Like the ones Courtney &amp; I saw last weekend at <a href="http://www.scottnicholsgallery.com/">Scott Nichols Gallery,</a> the prints are moderately sized. Well within the reach of the Epson. It's good to remember that big and better are non-aligned factors (even as I brood over the printing techniques C &amp; I also saw last week: 2- and 3-meter prints by <a href="http://www.thomas-wrede.de/">Thomas Wrede</a>, <a href="http://www.jmcolberg.com/weblog/archives/000229.html">Candida H&ouml;fer</a>, and <a href="http://www.lensculture.com/mt_files/archives/000032.html">Michael Wolf</a>).

The detail comparisons are the obvious ones. Can a 2K&#215;3K digi-cam image stand up next to a 5K&#215;5K scan from a 6x6 negative? I keep asking this same question. My feeling so far is that the MF always wins on tonal range and the look of MF <i>bokeh.</i> My MF cameras these days are my old YashicaMat and a recently-acquired even older cheapo one, but at f/8 or higher they are fantastic in tone and sharpness, easily close to the level of a Rollei (flare notwithstanding). The digi is the <a href="/blog/archives/000292.html">Cantax.</a> The Contax Zeiss glass really seems to pay off best as the sensor gets smaller. It's also a flatter field.

In raw detail from the scene, the digi holds up well against 6&#215;6 TXP and Neopan 400, processed in Rodinal 1+50. Though the visible grain of the film itself could be considered an extra edge. Against Neopan Acros, the old Yashica wins again. Guess I'll be using more of that  &#151; at the moment, Acros is one of the cheapest MF films that B&amp;H stocks. Sodding chore to scan it on my flatbed, though.

The second comparison is between B&amp;W printing via <a href="http://harrington.com/QuadToneRIP.html">Harrington Quadtone RIP</a>  (I'm still on the version 1) and printing directly to the Epson driver as a duotone. I'm a sucker for the brown tone but fear metamerism or worse. Still, some pretty sweet-looking shadows.

<i>PS: Yes, I know that Kyocera this week announced that all <a href="/blog/archives/000378.html">Contax film camera</a> production is halted, and digi by the end of the year. I almost never seem to buy any gear new anyway, heh.</i>
