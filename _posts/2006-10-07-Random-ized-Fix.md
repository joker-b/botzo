After a long dry spell, <a href="http://www.botzilla.com/photo/botzpix/">the photoblog sampler page</a> is functioning again. The previous page-builder script had been invalidated when Botzilla's host environment was changed by the ISP, but that software's now bee re-written.

Many of the thumbnails that appear on the sampler page a coming up as dummies currently, since there are no thumbs for most of the images used in the blog for 2005 and 2006. That will be remedied transparently as I create such images. Or maybe you like clicking on unknown question marks....

The page contains random links to images used in blog entries. Usually they are photos, though on rare occasion you may see a chart or title card. If you don't like the selection, you can try <a href="http://www.botzilla.com/cgi-bin/buildJournalPages.pl">randomizing it yourself.</a>
