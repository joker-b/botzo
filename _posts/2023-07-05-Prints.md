The past weekend I was very happy to have three new <a href="http://botzilla.com/liquiditysf/">Liquidity SF</a> prints hanging in the <a href="https://equalityvines.com/">Equality Wines</a> tasting room, part of <a href="https://www.oligallery.com/">Oli Gallery in Guerneville</a> -- after a related but wine-less run at the <a href="https://www.riverfrontartgallery.com/">Petaluma location.</a>

This coming Sunday will also see prints at the <a href="https://www.tritonmuseum.org/">Triton Museum</a> down in Santa Clara.

Two weeks ago the _American Grafitti_ 50th Anniversary-related <a href="https://petalumaartscenter.org/exhibitions/auto-mobility">"Auto-Mobility" show</a> closed - it had one of my "Cruisers" prints at the PAC, as did the "Community" competition show at <a href="https://theimageflow.com/">ImageFlow</a> in Marin County, early in the year.

My favorite part of openings, when possible: stand anonymously within earshot of your work, and listen to people explain it to one another -- even if they hate it. _Especially_ then!
