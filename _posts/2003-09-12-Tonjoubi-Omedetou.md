Two rolls of E-6 back from Calypso, one the new Velvia 100F (bought to try as an alternative to Ektachrome 100G). The slides look luscious but as in the past my scanner has a hard time getting detail from the shadows... though it's in there!</i>

The <a href="http://www.apug.org/" target="linkframe">APUG</a> turned one year old on the seventh of September &#151; this past Sunday. To commemorate, members were to each shoot something that day and post to a <a href="http://www.apug.org/site/main/album_cat.php?cat_id=8" target="linkframe">shared community gallery,</a> a little <a href="http://www.againstallodds.com/" target="linkframe">"Day in the Life"</a> approach. While I haven't processed or scanned everything I shot that day, I sent along the frame at right, from the first Sept 7th roll to be finished.

For the analog purist police, here's the shot data: Shot at close range on TMax 100, Contax G2, 28mm, AE f/5.6 at around 1 in the afternoon Tokyo time.
