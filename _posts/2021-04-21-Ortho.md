I had a lone roll of Rollei Ortho film, and some Rodinal. The combination _should_ result in some of the sharpest negatives available -- may as well try it out!

Rollei usually recommends another developer, but they do list Rodinal 1+50 at 10 minutes inside the box, so: that's what it got. This also gave me a chance to do a quick shake of the new TTArtisans 50mm ƒ/1.4 ASPH lens. I'll write more about _that_ later on, but in the mean time here are just a couple of frames from the Rollei negatives, along with 100% scanner crops, and further down, a comparison (for the film, not the lens) shot with a Nikkor 55mm micro-Nikkor (on a Nikon, of course), and finallly a quick comparison to a recent shot made with the X-Pro2 & the Fuji 16mm ƒ/1.4 (a 24mm-equivalent lens). It's everybody versus everybody, today.

### 50mm TTArtisans Lens

At 4800 dpi, Epson's scan resolution for a 35mm frame is nearly identical with that of the Fuji X-Pro2 sensor: about 6000x4000. Rollei claims the film can resolve up to 330 lines per mm, or over 8000 lines per inch. Well above the scanner capability. And far above the resolution of any lens for a 35mm camera, at least one made during the film era -- even the best ones will peak around 140 lpmm. Lower for SLR lenses.

Resolution's not the whole story for a film or a lens, but looking at a 100% crop I learned a couple of things about the film, about my scanner, and about this lens (I'll write more about the lens in another post -- including how it feels on both a regular-sized M body and the diminutive Leitz Minolta CL).

### 28mm M-Rokkor Lens

This second shot was made with the 28mm ƒ/2.8 M-Rokkor. That lens was made for the CLE, so I keep around an extra 28mm shoe-mounted viewfinder (the CL lacks a 28mm brightline, while the CLE has one -- but the CLE lacks the CL's 50mm lines...). In practice, the full view of the CL's finder is pretty close to 28mm already, though if I'm prefocused or zone focused it's a lot faster to just use the top-mounted finder or even just wing it, since I've developed a personal "internal viewfinder" too.

There are a lot of tonal gradients that I can appreciate in this image, and I was very pleased to discover some really small details in the far background. Again, the film is recording at the limit of the scanner and the lens.

## Neopan 1600 Super Presto

Fuji doesn't make this film stock any more. I bought in bulk, Way Back When, and about 15 rolls remain. I've been exposing it at around ISO 200 or 400, depending more on my mood than the demands of the scene. To match the Rollei film, I've also processed this roll in Rodinal 1+50, this time for 13 minutes. 

### 55mm ƒ/3.5 Pre-AI Micro-Nikkor Lens 

The shot below doesn't have a lot of sharp detail, but the edges it does have show off this 1960s Nikon lens pretty well, and the gradients reveal some of the grainy character in this film.

At web resolution, the old slow fast film still manages pretty well! At 100% the scan shows a lot more difference, as you might expect. But not as much, in truth, as I _had_ expected.

A surprise, when reviewing on the computer, was that the higher grain is apparent even in the little thumbnail views that Photoshop presents showing "recent files" -- while the thumbnails for the Rollei shots still look pretty clean.

## Fujifilm X-Pro2 w/16mm ƒ/1.4 WR

At this late stage for film cameras, no one should be surprised that the digital Fuji has detail to rival even Rollei Ortho 25. What surprised me is by how much it excels! But see for yourself. This is a six-year old X-Pro with a wide angle at ISO 400.

At 100% crop, the story's even clearer.

## What We Learned: B&W Film, B&W Digital

I'm not going to attempt any sweeping statements about these examples. Just a few simple ones:

<ul>
	<li>Rollei's film is swell, but if I want the ultimate available sharpness and clarity in rendering, digital is the way to go.</li>
	<li>For coarser films like the Neopan 1600, a sharp SLR lens will draw a lot of detail -- but the contrast is likely to be lower than that of a rangefinder lens (on reviewing the entirety of both rolls and some others, this seems fair to say the examples match this statement -- it's not a surprise).</li>
	<li>I doubt I'll buy more Rollei Ortho, though it's nice to have ISOs less than the low-end limits of most digital cameras -- ISO 200 or even higher. But there are less expensive panchromatic alternatives, like Acros or Pan F or adding an ND filter to push ISO 200 down to ISO 25.</li>
	<li>The sort-of-Leica M-mount lenses I have are both excellent performers for B&W film.</li>
	<li>I need to rememeber to disable unsharp masking on my scanner, when using Epson's software.</li>
	<li>I need to double-check the brightness ranges, when using Epson's software. Epson's default exposure clips a lot of the brighter pixels to a hard white -- to my eye, this destroys not only highlights, but grain structure too. Fortumately it's easy to adjust, but must be checked on each frame.</li>
</ul>

More generally, a reminder to myself: shooting film and shooting digital are increasingly differing. On most every technical measure, digital cameras win. The charm of film and film processes is not in those metrics.
