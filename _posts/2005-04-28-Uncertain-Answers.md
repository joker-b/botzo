Here's today's worthy answer to the question: <a href="/blog/archives/000391.html">"where are the good new B&W photographers?"</a>

In </a> <a href="http://unconfirmed-reports.com/">Unconfirmed Reports</a> photographer <a href="http://rossmcd.com/">Ross McDonnell</a> cannily uses the ambiguities of black and white to good purpose, re-modelling a collection of seemingly unconnected decisive moments into a crypto-narrative of uncertainty. Highly recommended.
