Shooting RAW mode, I can easily burn through a CD's worth of storage every day &#151; on a busy day, I can shoot a lot more than that (or a CD+ of JPEGs). Add two more cameras for Rebecca and Courtney, and it looks more and more like I'll end up spending an hour every day of the trip burning CDs (to say nothing of charging batteries), which means carrying a laptop in addition to my kit bag, and all of it hand-carried through multiple airports. Normal enough for a commercial trip, but for a vacation? I thought there was supposed to be some "fun" involved (wonder if there's electrical power on the flights...).

The alternative, ironically, is to progress backwards and shoot film, which is easier to stock-up in bulk, doesn't need a laptop, but will require time later for processing, scanning, and potentially printing and spotting.  It's tempting to bring both Contaxes as backups/overflow for the digitals (which was absolutely necessary on my last trip to London &#151; the CF cards filled fast) &#151; even if I were willing to drop a few hundred $ on extra CF cards. So much for the cheaper digital Promised Land.
