Currently in Minneapolis, a place where my net connections are painfully poor &#151; and we needed a quick snap in square format today, for inclusion in the next edition of  <a href="http://developer.nvidia.com/object/gpu_gems_home.html" target="gems"><i>GPU Gems.</i></a> Nothing like a 20-minute deadline and -3F weather with a -15F windchill to spur you :)

The current issue of  <a href="http://www.bandwmag.com/" target="gems">B&W Magazine</a> has just shipped &#151; it contains a photo by yha as part of its coverage of <a href="http://www.apug.org/" target="gems">APUG.</a>

Happy holidays!
