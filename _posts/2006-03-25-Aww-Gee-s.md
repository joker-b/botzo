One glance at Craig's List and 20 minutes later I was in possesion of <i>another</i> G, from a fellow just a few blocks away and dirt-cheap. So now I've got a Canon G5 to replace the long-suffering, taped-together, and now deceased <a href="https://www.botzilla.com/photo/g1links.html">G1,</a> and as a quiet digital companion to my <a href="http://contaxg.com/user.php?id=1678">Contax G2.</a>

Dumb? Hmm, just last week I picked up an LX1 (aka Leica DLux2) for the wide lens and the 16:9 aspect ratio (looks <i>cool</i> displayed on the Sony PSP &#151; a great way to carry a catolog of images, added to my other catalogs on the celphone and ipod)

I forgot to include my <i>other</i> G in this snap: the old <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/canonet/pool/73624728@N00/">Canonet G-III.</a> Ah well.

First impressions of the G5 over the G1: manual use is <i>incredibly</i> improved, along with strobe handling. Sounds like it's time to revise some of the Botzilla Canon pages, now that the G5 has been out of production for months...
