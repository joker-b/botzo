Sening out the first batch of _[Art Trails]({{ site.url}}/trails)_ promotional postcards -- basically, as many as I could send before I ran out of stamps. There are five designs, ordered pretty randomly.

A positive sign: when I brought these to the post office to send (and to buy more stamps), the postal clerk gave both sides a long look, then enthusiastically exclaimed "wow!" and said they'd try to come to the studio too.

That's _one,_ at least!
