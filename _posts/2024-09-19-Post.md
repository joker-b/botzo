This was the day for sending out the first batch of _[Art Trails]({{ site.url}}/trails)_ promotional postcards -- basically, as many as I had stamps. There are five card designs, ordered pretty randomly.

A positive sign: when I brought these to the post office to mail them out (and to buy more stamps), the postal clerk gave both sides of the cards a long look, then enthusiastically exclaimed "wow!" and said they'd try to come to the studio too.

That's _one,_ at least!
