<p>My two official-schedule <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/">GDC:06</a> presentations are now available online in <a href="http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2006/04/slideuments_and.html">slide-ument</a> form &#151; one presentation about general techniques in texture painting, applicable to anyone building models and painting them in games or movies; and the another specifically about the upcoming <a href="http://www.fxcomposer.com/">FX Composer 2.0.</a></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://developer.nvidia.com/object/texture-shaders-gdc-2006.html">When Shaders and Textures Collide</a></li>
<li><a href="http://developer.nvidia.com/object/fx-composer2-pipeline-gdc-2006.html">Cross-Platform Development Using FX Composer 2.0</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As for more informal presentations given at the <a href="http://developer.nvidia.com/">NVIDIA</a> and Sony booths, those were variants of the FX Composer 2.0 talk. If you're a registered Playstation3 developer, you'll find the software and more info already packed-up in your SDK :)</p>
