<p>As has been a habit, I'm coming to write up a usage report for a camera only by the time its replacement has been announced: the LX7 is about to make way for LX100 (or for the Leica marque, D-Lux Typ 109), which I'm sure will be a fine camera too. I'll stick to my 7 until circumstances warrant a switch -- which is how I felt about the LX5 for nearly a year after the LX7 first appeared. What finally changed my mind?</p>

<p><b>The aperture ring.</b> As much as possible I want a camera that I can use without needing to check menus and displays. If I can roll over to the far end of the apertures and then count clicks to know my f/stop, without ever taking my eye off the scene in front of the camera, I'm happy.</p>

<h4>Little Things Make a Difference</h4>

<p><img  src="http://www.botzilla.com/blog/archives/pix2014/bjorke_d_P1020649.jpg" border="0" hspace=6 align="right" class="img-responsive" /> Looking over the other improvements listed in the brochures: 1080p video, faster aperture, etc, none of them stand out as crucial differentiators for me except this: the LX7 uses the <b>same batteries as the LX5,</b> meaning that I could have two cameras with me using the same battery type. So leapfrogging my LX3 (different battery) with the LX7 meant I could set aside all those old batteries and chargers. This not-very-visible difference can be a huge deal when out running around shooting! One set of batteries to juice them all.</p>

<p>The photos on this post are from a springtime trip where we shared an LX5, LX7, and also brought along a <a href="/blog/archives/000794.html">Fuji X100s</a> as the "big" camera (more on that later). One set of Lumix batteries made for more relaxed days.</p>

<p>I was initially excited by the LX7's new 3D shooting feature -- we already have a 3D TV around, and I've shot a lot of stereo over the years. But in practice it's been used only once or twice.</p>

<p>That said, there are three other features of the LX7 that I've come to love: the <b>Outboard clip-on EVF,</b> the <b>ND filter,</b> and (to my surprise) <b>Dynamic Color Mode.</b></p>

<h4>EVF: (External) Electronic View Finder</h4>

<p>The similar <b>EVF</b> on the LX5 was already surprisingly great. The LX7's, while oddly chunky-looking, is even better. This became especially useful as I've also become keen on the &quot;dynamic color&quot; mode in both cameras. Yes, it's one of those gawky Instagram-ish filter modes. It has a beautiful ability to get detail out of shadows. It's tremendous on sculpture, on woodwork, it even has an occasional place in portraiture. Seeing it as you shoot: terrific.</p>

<h4>Built-In Neutral-Density (ND) Filter</h4>

<p>The <b>3-stop ND filter</b> is usually hyped as a means to use strobe outdoors. And yes, it does this too. But I've found it useful for another purpose: a three-stop drop is just about perfect as the difference between sunny exposures and sky-lit shady ones. Since I shoot a lot in changeable sun, among the skyscrapers of the San Francisco Financial District or in forest, the ND button is a great manual-exposure tool -- I set my manual exposure for shade, then with one press of the ND button, I'm good for sunshine. And vice versa. A very big deal for someone like me who likes to manage the camera by finger without taking my eye off the shot.</p>

<p>Using the LX7 in tandem with the <a href="/blog/archives/000794.html">Fuji X100S</a> ended up being a very enjoyable (silent and lightweight) travel/street combo: the LX7 provided wide and short telephoto ability, excellent macro, color fun (Fuji has similar modes, but I'm used to the LX!), and the occasional variance from the 3::2 format, while the Fuji provided amazing low-light performance and faster operation.</p>

<h4>Dynamic Color Mode</h4>

<p>Compare the "dynamic color" shot above to the standard one taken a few seconds later. It may not be "natural" but the detailed information in the shot, especially around the buildings in the background, is to my mind superior</p>

<p>This isn't to say that the standard color rendition is bad -- here are a couple of samples to show that it's the opposite! You can see the LX5 in this shot -- can you find the other snap of it in this post? And the (blurry) LX7?</p>

<p>Again, the dynamic color made really brings out fine scultural detail, as in this Rodin figure -- without having to resort to using a RAW file and manipulation in Photoshop later on.</p>

<p>Another quick comparison of color modes: Retro, Soft, and the surprisingly snappy Dynamic Monochrome.</p>
