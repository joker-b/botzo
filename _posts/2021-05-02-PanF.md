<center><i>Living Room Peonies<br/>TTArtisans 50mm Æ’/1.4 wide open, Pan F, D-76 1+1<br/><a href="http://www.botzilla.com/pix2021/bjorke_2021_05_M5_IMG_0330.jpg">Larger Scan</a></i></center>

Further cementing my decision not to buy more Rollei Ortho 25: this quick test roll with Ilford Pan F+ in D-76 (1+1,  8.5 minutes @ 20C, if you must know). D-76's different from the Rodinal used for the Rollei film, so it's not a direct comparison in every way, but... for a classic fine-grained 35mm look this combo feels like the right confluence of simplicity, availablity, and expense. 

And no, I've no aims of becoming a botanical photographer. This is just the sort of quick sketch that's easily made in a country-adjacent suburb while the world is still _mostly_ anchored at home. More grit and urban chaos to come, I'm sure.
