<center><i>Living Room Peonies, TTArtisans 55mm @ Æ’/1.4, Pan F<br/><a href="bjorke_2021_05_M5_IMG_0330.jpg">Larger Scan</a></i></center>

Cementing my decision not to buy more Rollei Ortho 25, this quick test roll with Pan F in D76 (8.5 minutes @ 20C, if you must know). Different from the Rodinal used for the Rollei, but... for a classic fine-grained 35mm look this feels like the right confluence of simplicity, availablity, and expense. 

And no, I've no aims of becoming a botanical photographer. This is just the sort of quick test one can execute in a country-adjacent suburb while the world is still _mostly_ anchored at home.
