It's been many days again since I've written here (though I have written a few short entries for <a href="http://www.photopermit.org/">PhotoPermit.Org</a>), a good chunk of them consumed
by reading. I feel like I've had some growth and change in the
way I approach picture books. And that's separate from doing a
perhaps nutty thing with photo books: trying to view them through
a camera viewfinder, to get a better grasp on what might have
been seen by the original shooter (something worth doing once, but if it's persistent,
call a doctor).

No, but I think my new plateau comes from a similar leap of imagination, of having a stronger sense of what was in the maker's mind for each image: where to stand with the camera, when to press the shutter; how to lay down the colors broadly and then to refine them with each successive stroke of the brush. The reading is slower but the enjoyment deeper.

Since <cite>Red Color News Soldier,</cite> which I'd <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2004-09-25-My-China %}">written
