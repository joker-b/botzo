One of the consequences of using the mixed B&W/color workflow that I described <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2007-02-13-Styling %}">a few posts ago</a> is that when browsing through Adobe Bridge, you end up seeing both B&W and color versions of <i>every</i> picture. Viewing everything doubled, side by side, is oddly informative.

Both forms have a <a href="http://www.auspiciousdragon.net/photowords/?p=292">flatness,</a> but also a sort of dimensionality that's unique to each. Both are flat, yet both are different. I've not made my mind up about the real dynamics of one or the other of the effects but they're... interesting.

Sadly my interest in these <a href="http://www.ted.com/tedtalks/tedtalksplayer.cfm?key=b_schwartz">choices</a> has been stomped on a bit, with the unfortunate theft of my 5D (and a 28mm &fnof;/1.8) a couple of days ago.  I still have my <a href="https://www.botzilla.com/blog/archives/000479.html">LX1</a> to continue as my RAW-making digi of choice, and I've been running the new Kodak Portras through the Bronica while I fume and decide what to do now that I'm dSLR-less. There are some projects that I needed that camera to continue on, that would have to mutate or die with out it. 

On the plus side, it is giving me a wee boost to remember some lingering film-based projects-in-progress.
