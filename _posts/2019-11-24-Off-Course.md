Back, and caffeinated.

So few blog posts during 2019 -- primarily because I've been very focused since February working on new products with <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision.</a> 

In truth, there are several draft posts that have been lingering in various states of being written or shot or shot and written. Like crunk, botzilla ain't dead.

<i>(And you might ask: if I'm working with InVision, why not use <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/studio">InVision Studio</a> to redesign botzilla.com? One thing at a time... and no more than one redesign per year for this site)</i>
