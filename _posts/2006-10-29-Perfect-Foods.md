Ah, the perfect food for the harried <i>sarariman....</i> 

Only been here a few hours, took an hour or two walk too clear my head and move my legs after the two two-hour tran rides and the 10+ hour flight. Took a couple dozen bad pictures but maybe a couple good ones, had a curry, drank-in the neighborhood. Always the same, always new. It's like running into an old girlfriend and finding out she's even more appealing than you remembered. <i>Dang.</i>
