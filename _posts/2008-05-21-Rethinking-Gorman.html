<p>It's been a couple of years now since I wrote <a
    href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2006-11-17-B-W-Conversions %}">this entry on
    digital Black and White conversions.</a>  I'm still using a variation of
    the Caponigro conversion described there. What prompted me here was a
    combination of events, including reconciling the many scripts and actions I
    had on several different Photoshop-equipped computers, each of which had
    diverged from ts brethren; meeting Bob Carnie at <a
    href="http://www.elevatordigital.ca/">Elevator Digital</a> in Toronto,
    thanks to <a href="http://www.apug.org/forums/members/dinesh/">Dinesh</a>;
    <a href="http://www.apug.org/forums/forum47/50493-b-w-film-shots-compared-b-w-digital-shots.html">this
    APUG thread</a>, which also included more info from Bob; and the latest
    edition of <a href="http://www.digitalphotopro.com/"><i>Digital Photo
    Pro</i></a> magazine, which has run B&W articles as its cover story quite a
    lot over the last year or two, and this one was no exception. What
    surprised me was that <i>DPP</i> were freshly touting the old <a

    href="http://www.johnpaulcaponigro.com/lib/artists/holbert.php">Holbert</a>
    method (aka <a
    href="http://www.gormanphotography.com/bw_conversion.pdf">the Gorman
    Method</a>). </p>

<p><img src="https://www.botzilla.com/blog/pix2008/GormanAction.jpg" width=179 height=326 border=0 align="right" />I've tried the Gorman method a few times in the past, stored actions for it
like many other people have no doubt, and... it puzzles me. It puzzles me because:</p>

<ul><li>It uses layers, but it's destructive -- you can't got back to the original
	unaltered picture, so you'd better be careful not to hit "Save" unless you're really
	certain that you're 100% done with the pic.</li>
    <li>It's not really a black and white conversion method! It's three different effects,
	one of which is a black and white conversion -- and a very plain-vanilla conversion,
	at that. The three (sub-)effects are:<ol>
	<li><b>Black and White Conversion.</b> The Gorman method uses a unadorned Lab conversion,
	    then propogates the "L" result t all channels before converting back to 
	    a full-color RGB image. That is, grab the "L" channel and that's
	    your monochrome image. What's puzzling about this is that "L" is essentially
	    a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space">straight
	    linear conversion.</a> If you work out the math and remember that
	    Photoshop locks the CIE illuminant term to "D50" (so all those
	    spooky cube roots are really just constants), then "L" is just 
           a weighted sum of the RGB channels:
	    more or less (depending on the color space of the original
	    image) 20% red, 70% green, and 10% blue. No contrast control
          just a simple straight conversion.</li>
	<li><b>Color toning.</b> Using the inverted image as a solid-color layer mask is a cute
	    idea for prepping the image for printing or other distribution, and I like
	    the suggestion to keep favorite tones in a palette. An odd part of the
	    <i>DPP</i> article is that Gorman is quoted as talking about
           using a completely
	    different method of selecting tones for printing -- implying perhaps that
	    this method is only useful for web presentations?</li>
	<li>A <b>high-pass overlay layer,</b> based on the resultant B&W image. Not a bad idea,
	    though the exact sizing of the effect's radius should be
          dependent upon the input size, rather
	    than a fixed value as written in the PDF.
          I also like how the blend has been
	    altered and feathered so that potential "halo" artifacts will be isolated to the
	    midtones, so that they won't appear in the most potentially troublesome parts
	    of the image -- you won't get light halos in black areas or dark halos in
	    highlight areas.</li>
	</ol></li>
    <li>It makes reference to adding curves or levels layers, but doesn't actually describe
	where they would be placed or how they would be used. In fact, since some of the
	scheme is destructive, you can't entirely be sure that the layers adjustments
	will entirely let you do what you desire, without having to repeat the later steps (which
	sadly is a limitation of Photoshop itself, which I'll describe later).</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>As an <i>Action</i> the method makes sense to some degree -- I can imagine applying it to
    whole directories of pictures at a time. What it lacks in control it  might make up for in
    volume, though you could say that about <i>any</i> Photoshop/Bridge/Lightroom action.</p>

<p>There's also the proof pudding -- Gorman's published shots. They genuinely
    look great, but... is it really the conversion, or the practiced studio photographer?
    If he really uses this method, my guess is that he's learned how to nail
    his desired B&W results time after time by rigid adherence until it has become
    very natural to use and light for this scheme.</p>

<P>Bob likes Lab too, according to the APUG thread. I'm still scratching my head, though I suppose
    that the same "use what works for you" logic could be behind his comments (and I have no
    argument with that line of reasoning, believe me). It's also true that using a combination of
    all three colors, regardless of just what that composition might be, has the potential to give
    you really smooth and gorgeous floating-point-precision gradients even without resorting
    to Dark Side trickery like HDR.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.botzilla.com/blog/pix2008/kbBW-layers.jpg" width=228 height=385 border=0 align="right" />Still, I like the <a
    href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2006-11-17-B-W-Conversions %}">Caponigro
    method,</a> and have adjusted it slightly since the previous entry. I don't
    try to put the color toning into the same operation, and I put all the
    adjustments into a folder, so I can turn them of and on as a group (or fade
    them by adjusting the opacity of the entire layer group at once).</p>
    
<p>I've also added a blank layer I label "burn" to the folder, and set its
    blend mode to "multiply." Anything I paint into this layer will essentially
    burn-down (darken) the corresponding areas of the final B&W image, and it
    too can ave varying opacity in case I get a little too heavy-handed wit the
    brush (which happens a fair bit). The illustration shows a complete
    "Modified Caponigro Method" folder.</p>

<p><i>What about that undisplayed "Layer 2" above the folder?</i></p>


<p>It's the result of my very favorite Photoshop key commands, a trick I've only heard verbally
    described as <i>"The Move."</i> It's <b>"ctrl-option-shift-E"</b> and does in one step what the
    Gorman method does in two -- it merges all visible layers into a new layer at the top
    of the stack (in the Gorman method, this is done by creating a blank layer and then running
    "merge visible" on that layer -- exactly the same result).</p>

<p>That "Layer 2" is just such a layer, which has then been hidden for later use (as we'll see).</p>

<p>A problem with (pre-CS4) Photoshop is that it doesn't let you specify arbitrary blend operations (or
    filters) on a folder. So the only way to use those sorts of effects are to do a "move," create
    that new layer, and then execute whatever on that layers pixels. That's what the Gorman method
    does for its high-pass layer, and how I use it will be described below.</p>

<p>These "merged" layers are great, but do remember -- if you edit any of the underlying Hue,
    Curves, etc layers, those changes will <i>not</i> automatically appear in the merged layer.
    Instead, you'll need to hide or delete the old merge and make a new one (clicking the little
    visibility icons then makes A/B comparisons pretty easy too, btw).</p>

<p>Recently, I've been experimenting with using these merge B&W layers to manipulate <i>color</i>
    images:</p>

<ol><li>Work out the B&W conversion using a folder, as described above.</li>
    <li>Create a merged layer using "The Move."</li>
    <li><i>Hide</i> the entire conversion folder by clicking on its little eye icon.</li>
    <li>Set the blend mode of the merge layer to "Luminance."</li>
    <li>Adjust opacity of the merged luminance layer to taste.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are some pics: the first is an un-modified original, followed by two possible B&W
    conversions, and then the color result of applying those conversions back to the original
    color image. In the first, darker one, I liked the somewhat bad-color-printing appearance
    it had. In the second, which also washed-out a lot of the detail in the freckles, the color
    becomes very soft, looking almost like hand coloring. The last in this group uses the same
    brght luminance source, but the effect is faded back by reducing the luminance layer's
    opacity.</p>

</p>

<p>As long as we're in Photoshop, it's hard to resist trying near-useless tricks, too. Here's
    a completely negative luminance applied to the original colors, and its
    inverse (which gives positive luminance to negative colors).</p>

<p>
<img src="https://www.botzilla.com/blog/pix2008/neg.jpg" width=200 height=324 border=0 />

<img src="https://www.botzilla.com/blog/pix2008/negC.jpg" width=200 height=324 border=0 />
</p>

<p>These samples use a different blend mode: the "lighter color" mode. The result (which looks
    best, IMO, when slightly faded back) gives slight variations in the overall color saturation
    according to the overall luminance -- another rather film-like effect and one I really like.</p>

</p>

<p>Finally, why not blend components of techniques for something new? The pics below show the
    high-pass layer from the Gorman technique, applied via "overlay" to the original color
    image.</p>

<p><b>So what about video games?</b><i>I would be remiss not to mention that
    <b>all</b> of these methods, except for the high-pass filter, can be
    executed in a <b>single unified pass</b> in hardware shaders, thus also
    making them appropriate for using in video games (the high-pass filter would
    require an additional render-to-texture pass). If you've been
    paying attention to <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2008/05/adobe_hydra_now.html">John Nack's blog,</a> you may also know that such effects
    will eventually be available in real time for Photoshop and Flash via
    "Pixel Bender" shaders.<i></p>
