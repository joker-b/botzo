Over on <a href="http://coincidences.typepad.com/" target="contax">Coincidences</a>, Robert has occasionally <a  target="contax" href="http://coincidences.typepad.com/still_images_and_moving_o/2004/01/sharing_your_ph.html">sung </a>the praises of <a href="http://www.contaxg.com/">ContaxG.Com.</a> It's one of a few sites centered around equipment that actually seems to function well not as a site of <a target="contax" href="http://mejac2.palo-alto.ca.us/leica-users/">LUG</a>-like arguments over esoteric attachments and SKU numbers, but as a site about pictures, which just happen to have been made with a particular kind of camera.

ContaxG.com concentrates primarily on pictures made with equipment, rather than equipment first and picture galleries second. In this respect it's unlike other brand-centric sites like <a href="http://www.nikonians.org/" target="contax">Nikonians</a> or the Nikonian proxies <a href="http://www.canonians.com/" target="contax">Canonians</a> (which seems to function as much as a venue for the shooting of its owner as a Canon resource) or <a href="http://www.theminoltians.com/" target="contax">the Minoltians.</a> Great sites, but let's be honest &#151; they're about branding first and foremost.

## Before The Fall

Part of the character of <a href="http://www.contaxg.com/" target="contax">ContaxG</a> probably comes from  the apparent reality that while <a target="contax" href="http://www.kyoceraimaging.com/product.asp?itemnum=202000">still sold by Contax,</a>  the G system is approaching obsolescence &#151; 35mm film-based and without a new item in the line since the year 2000 or so. Without a continuous stream of new products, it's immune to the usual <a href="http://www.photographyblog.com/" target="contax">flood of equipment marketing announcements with hardly any real photo content.</a>  It's all below the consumer-products radar.

At the same time, the G1 and G2 haven't got decades of history like some other brands, so they're immune to the rampant collector-dom of sites like LUG or <a href="http://www.stutterheim.nl/rollei/rolleigraphy.html" target="contax">Rolleigraphy.</a> Instead of fretting over storing Tele-Rolleis, NOOKY-HESUMs or PLOOTs in airtight anti-humidity cabinets, G users are just left talking about a few canonical bits of kit and... making pictures.

Part of its success is surely due as well to Glen Campbell's handmade <a href="http://siteframe.org/" target="contax">SiteFrame</a> CM software, which stresses mixed graphical content to a far greater degree than sites like <a href="http://www.rollei-gallery.net/" target="contax">Rollei-Gallery</a> or <a href="http://www.leica-gallery.net/" target="contax">Leica-Gallery</a> or higher-traffic sites like <a href="http://www.photo.net/" target="contax">photo.net</a>

Siteframe has grown with ContaxG and has permitted (encouraged) the experience of members to grow and change the software. In fact it ran through a complete redesign after Glen took over <a href="http://contaxg.com/contaxuser/" target="contax">the original Contax G User page</a>... (arguing once again for the validity of <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html" target="contax">doing software rewrites,</a> once you figure out what you really wanted the software to do!) The emerging-usage-pattern has spread to other SiteFrame photo URLs beyond the G, whether it be for <a href="http://contaximages.com/" target="contax">other Contax cameras,</a> <a href="http://fujirangefinder.com/">Fuji MF and XPan rangefinders,</a> or for <a href="http://not.contaxg.com/" target="contax">anything but the G.</a>

Despite its potentially-fading technological edge, the Contax G still does its job like the professional tool it was designed to be, and the cameras already extant are likely to keep operating for a long time. And it keeps attracting new converts.  The G site had over a thousand new members in the past year alone, many of them from eastern europe and asia but also more than a few from the US, a fact I realized while looking at the portfolio of one of my favorite new members <a target="contax" href="http://contaxg.com/user.php?id=3730&page=user_images">Jason Hupe.</a> Good to see the old G1 finding such able hands.

It's also good to find collections like Jason's on a site like ContaxG, not in yet another photoblog &#151; not <i>everything</i> needs to be reduced to a photo per day, even when much of it's diaristic like Jason's photos.

The Photoblog format is, like blogging itself, a little too easy to hide behind &#151; easy to feel like you've done something constructive simply by staying close to the comforting convention.

I'm also a bit perplexed at the habit, on so many photoblogs, to index their entries according to the equipment used (This post is the first I'll try using MT's cross-index posting: <i>three topics at once!</i>). It feels like a blog version of license plates that read <b>F150</b> or <b>BLUCHVY</b>. I wonder if I should start doing the same...
