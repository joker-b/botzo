Okay, when I asked <a href="archives/000043.html">a few days ago</a> about <i>any</i> 3D computer blog sites, I really meant any 3D animation sites that:

<ol>
<li>Had 3D info consisting of more than rehashing of industry press releases</li>
<li>Was able to talk about 3D without making reference to numbered Bible verses.</li>
</ol>

So <a href="http://www.popedeflash.com/blog/" target="linkframe">this</a> doesn't quite make it.
