Unearthed, thought lost but found in a dutifully-automated archive: a mixture of Armageddons from Breughel and ISIS, made using software I was writing in late 2015. A collision of apocalyptic worldviews.

Since then: fire, drought, tyrants, protests, Panama papers, plagues of mice and microorganisms.
