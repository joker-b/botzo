I'll be the first to say that I find most Holga/Diana-wana-be photgraphy cloying and twee and it's pretty rare that even the most earnest results feel like anything more than just a rehash of <a href="http://www.foundobjectsgallery.com/bartender/2008/02/07/nancy-rexroth/">Nancy Rexroth's "IOWA."</a> So you can imagine my reflex reaction to programs that deliberately "crappify" otherwise-clear, direct images, burying them under just so much mannered noise. And you'd be right, at least about my initial reaction. Why my attitude has changed in the <a href="/blog/archives/000732.html">next photorant entry.</a>

In the mean time, since I couldn't find one that entirely suited me, here are a couple of guides to the color modes (and below, frame styles) offered as presets by the Android camera-phone program <a href="http://neilandtheresa.co.uk/Android/Vignette/"><i>Vignette.</i></a> A similar chart can be found <a href="http://www.schussman.com/article/great-android-apps-vignette">here,</a> but it was missing skin tones).
