I've been slow as a congressman on getting the rest of my gear together, but I think I've decided the new piece: a <a href="http://www.aqualung.com/products/pro_qd_p2.html">Sea-Quest Pro QD+ BCD</a> &#151; the lift and sizing seems right for me and the price isn't too grim...

That still leaves me without my own a regulator (I'll probably go for an <a href="http://www.aqualung.com/products/titan_lx_p2.html">Aqualung Titan LX</a>), an octopus (<a href="http://www.aqualung.com/products/octopus_lx.html">Aqualung Legend</a>), some sort of console/SPG/computer (<a href="http://www.oceanicworldwide.com/p_computers_veo180.html">Oceanic Veo 180</a>?). So another $600 of stuff to get after this next purchase. Plus Oceanic will hit me for another $90 for a cable to connect the dive computer to your PC :/ I still won't have tanks or weights, but who buys tanks or weights? Plus I have to save-up for that swell <a href="http://www.oceanicworldwide.com/p_computers_iddm.html">heads-up display</a> (it's not clear if the HUD will integrate an <a href="http://www.oceanicworldwide.com/p_mp3player.html">underwater MP3 player</a>).

It has occured to me, of course, that I could have gotten a nice <a href="http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&fcategoryid=139&modelid=10464">Canon 20D</a> for the same overall cost. But the 20D would just be a new version of what I already have. It makes pictures, just like my other picture-taking tools. The scuba gear makes completely new experiences.
