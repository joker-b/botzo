<br /><i>Color study shot for <a href="http://www.riftgame.com">Rift: Planes of Telara</a></i>

Earlier this week we were privileged to have painter & storyteller <a href="http://jamesgurney.com/">James Gurney</a> visit the art department at Trion, both to have him speak with us and also for us to get a chance to show him our game. He's best-know to the public for the <a href="http://www.dinotopia.com/"><i>Dinotopia</i></a> books (favorites at our house for many years -- See See & I were also lucky enough to see the <i>Dinotopia</i> show at the <a heaf="http://www.norton.org/">Norton Museum</a> in Palm Beach a few months back), and known to a lot of artists for his <a href="http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.com/">blog</a> and several <a href="http://nationalartgallery.sg/the-canvas/fresh-paint/top-5-books-for-any-art-junkie/">art technique books,</a> including the new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Color-Light-Guide-Realist-Painter/dp/0740797719/ref=pd_ts_b_5?ie=UTF8&s=books"><i>Color and Light: A Guide for the Realist Painter.</i></a>

We got the chance to look at some advance copies of the book and  also hear him talk a little bit about (among many other things!) how the brain processes color and luminance separately -- which of course reminded me of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2003-09-15-Scotopic-Photo-Topic %}">this old post on the Black and White Brain.</a> It's exciting to me to see someone as accomplished as Gurney coming at the same ideas from a different direction and for different purpose.

It's been several years now where I find that some of the biggest sources of information for my work in computer-graphic coloring and shading come not from computer scientists or even other people doing similar work -- instead, they come from painters. Not just realist painters, either. Gradations, highlighting, punctuation, contrast, shape -- increasingly I think of shading as a sort of painting-without-drawing.
