Using my head makes me think about what will be overexposed, underexposed, and where the tones will land. Even if only guessing, this seems a worthy enterprise. And in shots like the one at right, it gave me exactly what I wanted, which was further from "correct" than the two stops of "compensation" the automated cameras provide.

Monday: <a href="/photo/salon">SP Salon</a> later today, the theme: "Power Relations." I'm thinking one of the photos from <a href="/blog/archives/000048.html">Saturday</a> might do nicely.
