<center><i>1970s Leica CL, Neopan 1600 in X-tol</i></center>

Close to the last exposures on my 15-year-old spool of Neopan 1600, rated variously at ISOs 100 to 400 and attempted in Rodinal, D-76, and X-tol. I adored this film when it still had a rating of 1600 -- but today, expired and degraded, there's too much pain and grain for too little gain. The next sixteen rolls in the bulk loader are HP5, and Pan-F is on deck.

As a learning/relearning opportunity, sure. It's been a surprise to realize how many of my old film skills remained, but also how many had been forgotten or erased by a decade and a half of digital shooting. The biggest challenge in relearning is trying to sort out what you know from what you _think_ you know. Or thought you knew until the negative comes back thin and soft-focus as a cloud's ghost.
