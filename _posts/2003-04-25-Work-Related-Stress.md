I'm not really much of a fan of movie award shows, what with the overprimped and overpriveleged sweating it out in awkward suits and haircuts more-approriate to a high school homecoming pageant than grown-up behavior. And worse-yet is the near-complete dismissal of the 99% of the film community (including the writers) who make the films.

But I think I'm learning to be a lot more forgiving after finding out how the Iranian film awards work, according to <a title="albawaba.com: Iranian actress flogged 74 times for kissing director" href="http://www.albawaba.com/headlines/TheNews.php3?sid=247786&lang=e&dir=entertainment" target="linkframe">albawaba.com.</a>

I don't know what the IA and SAG are saying about this sort of thing, but now a little overtime on the weekend isn't sounding too bad.
