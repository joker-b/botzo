It's <a href="/photo/salon/">Streetphoto Salon</a> day once more, today's theme: <a href="/photo/salon/bjorke_dupl1.html"><i>Duplicity.</i></a>

Scanning the last round of negatives, I can see that the heavy filtration has worked, but only to a degree. On a couple of rolls the dirt is almost eliminated, but there are still occasional cabbage-shaped patches that look like hard water stains. Maybe not enough wetting agent on the final rinse?

Very busy these past few days &#151; still almost a dozen rolls in the "unprocessed, pending" box.
