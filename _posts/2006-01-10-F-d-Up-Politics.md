A couple of days ago I was having a coffee-shop stop and spied a travel book. At that moment, I realized something important:

If the letter "F" were prepended to Ireland, then it would be Fireland. Which would be <i>great,</i> because they would be the closest country to Iceland. Then, they could have a war!

It would be so cool. Err, hot.
