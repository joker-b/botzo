<p>Tonight, perhaps for the first night in a while, I managed to stay home mostly, save for a jot to the market. It let me knock-off the last bits of several library books that I'd been lingering on, but that are now due to return to their many homes across the state:</p>

<p>All photo books, heh &#151; I didn't actually expect that this time 'round. And most all of them books I've had out before. Guess I just needed the company of old friends.</p>

<p>A few nights back I purchased Seligman's <cite>Authentic Happiness</cite> and even signed up for his <a href="http://www.reflectivehappiness.com/">web program</a> but so far I haven't had time to even start on authentic happiness, just my usual ad-hoc franken-happiness.</p>
