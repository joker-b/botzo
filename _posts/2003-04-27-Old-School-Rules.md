<i>Three rolls Delta 400, Xtol 1::1, 11.5 mins @ 20C. One TMX, 9.5 mins.</i>

Shot-but-unprocessed backlog down to zero again, save for the two rolls currently loaded: one in the Contax and one in a Canon SLR. One of today's rolls, now hanging to dry in the shower, was deliberately shot without any light metering. As I hoped, it looks just as consistently-exposed as any of the the others.
