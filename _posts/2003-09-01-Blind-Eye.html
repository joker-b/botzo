<p>"Please Sir come down from there! No picture! No picture!"</p>

<p>Well what the heck did these guys think would happen? Next time  they
should consider these things first: If you park a motorized howitzer in the middle of the sidewalk in a busy city during morning rush hour, leave it unattended with the hatches open, and place a short run of portable steps next to it, what do you think will happen? People will walk up those steps and get a
look-see.</p>

<p>Their surprise and paranoia was inexplicable. <i>We are going to park a 20-ton <a href="http://www.add.re.kr/eng/weapon/2.asp" target="linkframe">K1A1 main battle tank</a> in the middle of your street. Please do not look very closely.</i></p>

<p>That is, don't look at it unless we think we want you to look at it. The howitzer, the tank (the bottom of the table of specifications reads: "Hunter/Killer... Yes"), the motorized bridge section, the armored retrieval vehicle... all parked on the sidewalk and every one of them... <i>for sale,</i> today through Wednesday, a "show special price" no doubt, just during Defense Asia Week 2003. Preferably a large sale, volume pricing appropriate for one or two divisions.</p> 

<p>No stickers on the windows, but a placard of specs in front of each, and decorated with large, festively-colored balloons to complete the used-car-lot theme. The black-suited salesmen are looking anxious as I step down. Who is this American guy, part of some industrial group, a customer, or a competitor?</p>

<p>"Please sir, no pictures." Yeah, whatever.</p>

<p>When I pass by again, three hours later, the suits from the hunter/killer marketing department have been reinforced with armed guards, wearing impressive brocades and polished helmets emblazoned with their section name. The helmets on some guards seem to be riding low &#151; the guards are obviously still in their teens. Their faces display the typical teenaged disaffected ennui as they pace idly back and forth.</p>

<p>Suddenly I remember the <a href="/blog/archives/000245.html">Vietnamese VIPs from yesterday</a> &#151; ah, it's starting to make sense.</a></p>
