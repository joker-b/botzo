Each roll tagged by date. In general, this also corresponded loosely with subjects, locations, and projects.

Now, the camera software splits everything into days. On a busy day that can mean hundreds of photos in the same directory, where before I could be confident know it was unlikely that there'd be more than 40. Add CDs to the equation and it's clear the old system will have to go. What I haven't settled on is a replacement.

Suggestions?
