<i>Six rolls Tri-X, two rolls Acros, rolls Neopan 1600 in Fomadon F09 (Rodinal formula) 1+40, then two rolls of Neopan 1600 stand-developed in F09 1+80 for an hour.</i>

Obviously this shot isn't mine, but I've decided to start including some shots that I've felt strongly about, shots that I think have had a direct personal effect. Unlike Roland Barthes I don't think first of family photos. Neither is it some list of "my favorites" or "greatest" shots. They're just shots that changed the way I thought about pictures and picture-making.

Over the past couple of days I've come to recall and identify so many shots that really connected to me, really stayed in my head and defined or especially re-defined what a picture can be. I've scribbled-out a little list in my personal notebook, and at the head of that list is W. Eugene Smith.

My parents always had <cite>Life</cite> magazine around and its influence on my early awareness of pictures can't be understated. I was probably twelve years old when I saw Smith's <i>pieta,</i> "Tomoko Uemura in Her Bath." At that age my initial reaction was terror. As much as I came to admire the radiant love of Tomoko's mother in this shot I can still remember the twelve-year-old shock and fear of drowning helpless in the black, black water. 

I was already interested in photography, but was distracted more by equipment than by pictures &#151; this photo is one of the earliest I can remember that grabbed me like this one did (still does). The smoke, the pool of light and the encroaching claustrophic black. 

I had no idea what kind of film or equipment Smith used &#151;  to this day I don't, and don't really care.
