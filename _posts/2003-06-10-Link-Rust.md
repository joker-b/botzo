I've been scrubbing. Not my home (though maybe I should), but my home page. Touchups, tuning, correcting crosslinks from <a href="http://www.finchnest.com">finchnest.com,</a> re-filtering the old <a href="/photo/photoBook/pbook.html">guestbooks,</a> splitting-off <a href="/house/book/tbook2002.html">old entries,</a> and trying to catch-up on un-replied correspondence.

"Link rot" is the term for old links to pages that no longer exist &#151; maybe "link rust" should be for pages that are used every day but are overdue for polishing, even as new content is waiting? I've got over 150 updates pending in my inbox just for the <a href="/photo/strobeVolts.html">strobe voltage page.</a> Agggnhh.
