I believe this is now day 195 of the Sonoma Shelter-in-Place against Covid-19. We've also had a half-dozen serious wildfires since the last festival at the County Fairgrounds. It finally cleared this morning, for the first time since August 18th to have smokeless skies.

Also, according to my <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K0ZOp5HY7nsAktola6QfajUH4uul1QqXnd34hPNQT_0/edit?usp=sharing">ongoing Covid tracker for Sonoma COunty,</a> the number of active cases here has been in decline since about the first of the month.
