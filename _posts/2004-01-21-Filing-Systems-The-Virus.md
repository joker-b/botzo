So during the <a href="http://www.sfbaybloggers.com/">South Bay Bloggers'</a> Meetup on Tuesday Night, I discovered a new sport: <i>Google Voyeur.</i>

Simplicity itself: take a typical digital-camera photo ID, like ih, Title: 143_4354

Now, just <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=143_4354&svnum=10&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=iw">poke that number into Google.</a> Chances are, it'll come up with other people's digital photos. Their personal photos, dutifully crawled and catalogued by Google's robot.
