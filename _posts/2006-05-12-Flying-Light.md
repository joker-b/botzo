Another cycle of airplanes, heading on a circuit 'round Scandinavia for most of the week. I'm letting Reb take the Canon for her own trip to New Jersey, and I'll be carrying just the LX1 and the Bronica.

I've hardly touched the Bronica for the last couple of months &#151; mostly just too busy! Hardly any processing or scanning has gone on since January, shame on me (even as I've been shooting film, buying developer and bulk rolls, etc).

Funny, I've never posted many impressions about the Bronica &#151; <a href="http://www.shutterflower.com/RF645%20review.htm">George Masters has,</a> but he missed one crucial flaw: the meter is not TTL and it's entirely possible to shoot a whole roll of 220 film without ever realizing that the lens cap is still on. Not that <i>I</i> would know anything about that.....

Still, a lovely camera. I just got back the color negs from February's dogsledding extravaganzo, and hope to have a few up on the web some time soon.
