<p class="well"><i>"Interpretation is the revenge of the intellect upon art. Even more. It is the revenge of the intellect upon the world. To interpret is to impoverish, to deplete the world   in order to set up a shadow world of 'meanings.' It is to turn the world into this world. ('This world'! As if there were any other.)"</i> &mdash; <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/2015/01/16/susan-sontag-against-interpretation-content/">Susan Sontag</a></p>
